Yes , hello .
Good evening .
I brought along a story .
The story of the highest mountain in the world .
And there are two reasons why I 'm telling you this story and why I 'll be reporting from my diary of the last five years .
One reason is a very personal one .
I decided to start living and working differently five years ago .
and what I 'm about to tell you really happened to me .
they â€™ re not some sort of concepts and ideas that I simply made up .
The second reason I want to tell you about the highest mountain in the world is that our society is right in the middle of a huge transformation process and we are often faced with thinking barriers and self-imposed mental blocks .
And I 'd like to talk about these self-imposed mental blocks by using this metaphor or story about the highest mountain in the world and talking to you about it .
When you do empirical research about what people consider to be the highest mountain in the world , then many minds come up with , and also in conversations I had with people , regardless of their profession , regardless of their background or the cultural circles they move in , the answer usually is that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world .
And I often asked myself , while doing my empirical research , whether I was also sure that the highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest .
And everyone claims with utter certainty , yes , the highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest .
That 's totally normal to us .
This image in our head that the highest mountain in the world is over eight thousand metres high .
I thought the same thing until two thousand and eight .
and I gave exactly the same answer .
until I stood at the top .
and someone said to me , welcome to the highest mountain in the world .
Which somehow unsettled me a bit , because it messed up the picture I 'd had up till then of seeing the world somehow , yes .
And the person who said welcome to the highest mountain in the world said , you know what , it has to do with the frame of reference we use when looking at mountains .
And depending on the frame of reference we use when looking at a mountain , one mountain or another is the highest in the world .
if you measure a mountain from sea level , then this is the highest mountain in the world .
And if you measure a mountain from , well , the beginning of the mountain , then Mauna Kea on Hawaii , with ten thousand two hundred and fifty metres , is the highest mountain in the world .
That then made me curious and thoughtful somehow .
And I started to experiment , in my thoughts at first .
and then in my life and in my work .
I looked into the question of whether the exact same might apply to management , economy , the banking and financial industry , in that we have a fixed opinion about these three phenomena , a fixed frame of reference .
And that , when taking a closer look , you can look at these things through a different frame of reference .
And then in two thousand and nine I started having conversations , reading books , going to events .
Organising events myself .
Always focusing on the question of whether there are other frames of reference in management , economy , the banking and financial industry .
And I can tell you one thing , there are other frames of reference .
They exist .
They 're available .
The exciting question is whether we want to see them .
This quote frequently accompanied me on my expedition .
The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes , but in having new eyes .
I 'd like to give an impetus by looking at a frame of reference for management , a frame of reference for economy , and a frame of reference for the banking and financial industry .
And there 's no need to be afraid that I , as an Austrian , will start talking about mountain climbing now and that you 'll have to get out a rope and pick and that we 'll go on an excursion .
We 're already on an excursion , but a mental one and not actually a mountain climbing expedition .
Management is the first subject that we 'll shed some light on .
The classic frame of reference in management , the Mount Everest of management , you could call it , is characterised by a few aspects that are entirely normal to us .
Management is hierarchy .
Management is command and control .
Management is , there are those who lead , and there are those who carry out .
And it 's also entirely normal to have the view in management that it needs change .
It , the company , the circumstances , yes .
And usually it 's the manager , the person , who is at the forefront of this change process .
When you ask people what irritates and annoys them most about their work , then the term change management is often cited , because something always has to change somehow .
Another frame of reference in management that I came across in many , many discussions and which I practice myself today is management innovation .
Managers work on their own quality , change the perspective of the company , the clients and all the stakeholders using their own qualities , thus bringing in an entirely different change dynamic for the company , entirely different compared to when you simply always change the circumstances or they change .
The old paradigm , the Mount Everest of management , is to change from the outside , the Mauna Kea of management is to change from the inside .
Economy as another frame of reference .
The Mount Everest of economy is also in our heads , in our hearts , in our actions .
Completely obvious .
When you ask people , what do you associate with economy ?
Then students , all the way to those who have been professionally active in leadership positions for years , will very , very quickly answer , economy is rivalry , economy is competition , and economy is profit seeking .
It 's it 's entirely normal for us to , well , think of economy in this way .
The Mauna Kea of economy is entirely different .
The Mauna Kea of economy might be that all economic activity serves the common welfare .
And , ladies and gentleman , all economic activity serving the common welfare is not just an esoteric possibility that some softies came up with .
But all economic activity serves the common welfare is included in the Bavarian constitution , among other places .
Very prominently .
Basically the way we want to carry out economic activity and how we relate to the economy as a society is anchored there .
A second aspect of Mauna Kea , of the close frame of reference for the economy , is to focus on striving for the common welfare and not profit seeking .
There is a social movement , the common welfare economy , in which I 've been involved on a voluntary and civic basis to a high degree for a year and a half now , where , by now , over a thousand companies carry out their economic activity in a different way , who understand and practice their economic activity as a striving for the common welfare and cooperation and not according to the old paradigm of Mount Everest .
Here in Stuttgart there is a regional group , an initiative .
and there are the first pioneering companies here in Stuttgart that practice their economic activity in a different way , yes .
And thus create a different frame of reference .
The third frame of reference , which I dealt with on my research and development excursion is the banking and financial system .
There are two reasons why I looked at the banking and financial system .
On the one hand I once studied to be a banker in the dim and distant past and was always active in bank management .
It 's my profession , and I still like and appreciate it very , very much .
That 's one reason , and the other reason is that in two thousand and eight , two thousand and nine , we were in the middle of the financial crisis and many things we had considered completely normal in the past started to falter .
The Mount Everest of banks is that we think it 's entirely normal for banks to be involved in global financial and casino capitalism and to be highly speculative enterprises .
It 's entirely normal for us to somehow accept that banks have nothing to do with the real economy .
The only thing I often get the impression does still annoy us about banks is that there are somehow managers who have high salaries , which is certainly an aspect .
But the real problem is that the bank 's system is a speculative and no longer a real economic aspect .
That 's the Mount Everest of the banking system .
If you look at banks through the Mauna Kea glasses , through a different frame of reference , then it makes sense of course that banks exist to turn money back into a means for the common welfare and which simply leave behind the old paradigms of a monetary and financial system and redefine them .
And of course it makes sense that there are banks that finance projects that are , well , common welfare-oriented and that finance subjects that we are driving forward in society .
I 've mentioned it , that old frame of reference bad bank .
It was used often enough in two thousand and eight , two thousand and nine during the financial market crisis .
What It 's not only about abolishing banks , but about seeing banks differently , yes , helping to create good banks basically .
I 've been involved in a project for almost a year with a group of one hundred and twenty active people , in Austria , in Vienna , , who are currently setting up a good bank .
We , that is , a voluntary , civil and social initiative comprising one hundred and twenty people are currently preparing the founding of a good bank .
And this good bank , we 're not doing it for our one hundred and twenty people , we 're basically just the founding committee .
We 're just taking the first steps .
We 're seeing to it that it gets out onto the streets .
Yes .
We want to see this bank reaching twelve thousand , twenty thousand , thirty thousand people .
And the best thing would be for every one of the bank 's clients to be one of the owners too .
Because we believe this is an essential prerequisite for not only setting up a bank as a good bank , but also for it to remain a good bank .
And possibly this idea of founding , well , a new bank , having a new kind of bank , will celebrate a triumphal procession through Austria or Germany too .
And maybe I can then report on how the whole thing happened at other Teds or Ted X events .
We 're right in the middle of preparing the founding .
In the in the second half of the year , now , in two thousand and thirteen , we will apply for a concession at the Forum for Financial Market Supervision and the bank will be set up in two thousand and fourteen .
In Austria , to start off with .
If we find one hundred and twenty people here in Stuttgart , I could do the project in Stuttgart too again .
Then we 'll found our own bank again there .
I can tell you one thing , many people said at the beginning , that 's not possible , starting up your own bank .
It certainly is .
And it 's very easy too .
It 's just quite a lot of work , but that 's not so bad .
The work can be done .
And if you divide it up between one hundred and twenty people , you can manage that well too .
The quintessential aspect when thinking with frames of reference is that every voyage , even if it 's very long , starts with the first step .
And I personally decided to take the first steps five years ago .
My life , my work and my loves look very different now than they did five years ago .
I would have never dared to dream that I 'd be standing on the stage now and quoting from my diary .
And that pleases me every day and every hour .
I can only encourage you to simply question the frames of reference , question the things that are completely obvious to you .
Things where you say , it 's simply like that .
Political speak tends to like to use the phrase there is no alternative .
whenever , you hear this inner voice rise up and say , there is no alternative , take a closer look .
Perhaps it 's supported by this Mount Everest image , or Mauna Kea , and just look and ask yourself , is that really true ?
Or isn 't there simply another frame of reference for exactly the subject you are dealing with .
There are another nine presentations at Ted X today .
I can imagine , I haven 't heard them , I only know as much about them as you , I can imagine that there will be one of two aspects , ways of looking at things differently too , looking at things through different glasses .
And I 'm just excited to hear the conversations the many people here will have in the breaks .
Yes , always with the object of researching what frame of reference you are dealing with most at any given moment .
What is your normal frame of reference and which one could be your new one .
Thanks for listening , and enjoy the event .
And I hope there are some lively conversations to come .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Is the mic working ?
Yes , it seems to work .
Great .
I would like to ask you to briefly close your eyes and think of the person who is the reason you are here today .
The reason you have done a degree , the reason you have managed to graduate from school and you have managed to find your own way .
You can now open your eyes again , but maybe keep that person in the back of your mind .
This role model .
I also had a person like that .
It was Mister Barrett .
Mister Barrett was my English teacher from eighth grade .
I had started learning English a long time before that .
But every time I knew that I would soon have to go to class , I would get all flustered .
And I would really rather just run away .
What I was most scared of , was speaking in English or having to read a text out loud .
And then came Mister Barrett , and he really did not care .
He also did not care about what I said or how I said it .
The only thing he found important , was that I said something .
And he tried to break it down for me , and with that he got me to start learning the English language piece by piece .
One year later , I applied to go on a student exchange in Los Angeles .
And I was the second best in English in my year , during my school leaving examinations .
What does that mean ?
That I was lucky .
I had a role model and I had someone to support me .
And I had someone who believed in me and encouraged me to learn this language .
And therefore , I have learned a lot that I can use for the rest of my life .
Unfortunately , in Germany there are many many children and young people , who do not have such role models and support .
In figures , it looks as though one in five primary school pupils needs further support in maths , even from the fourth grade , and therefore has a slim chance of successfully passing their school leaving exams .
Over fifty thousand young people drop out of school every year , without having graduated from high-school .
And nineteen percent of all fifteen-year-olds don 't have the required reading skills in order to understand a simple newspaper article .
This shock hit me in two thousand and six .
And it was so , that a school in Berlin , a secondary school in NeukÃ¶lln , the RÃ¼tli School , which some of you might have heard of , published an urgent letter .
The members of staff said , that learning can no longer take place in this school , because everyday life was ruled by violence , disrespect and hopelessness .
And at that exact time , I had to decide what I wanted to focus my Master 's thesis on .
And somehow , I did not merely want to fabricate a scientific paper , which would then be read at most by my professor or proof-reader and that would not be of any interest to anyone .
And these two issues came together and motivated me to focus my research on how education and deprived areas could be a successful concept .
And then I found it in Harlem .
So I came to the school and passed through the barred entrance , and I was then searched by two policemen .
In the school there was great fear , that the neighbourhood drug dealers had already approached the second graders and they wanted to expand their business .
I was rather shocked by that , as , of course , it was not as bad in NeukÃ¶lln yet .
I then went into a classroom , where a class of second graders were sitting .
Twenty highly interested and concentrated faces were looking at me .
Only one of them was white .
In an area , where at most ten percent of the population even make it into college .
How many of those then get a college degree , is a completely different question .
And those twenty second graders had their sights set on one goal .
And they had visually displayed this goal on their classroom wall .
They had displayed the College Walk of Fame for each child .
This idea was brought to them by a young teacher , who had moved to New York from Los Angeles .
She knew of course of the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles .
And she worked with each child on the steps they would have to take , in order to go from the second grade in Harlem to college and graduate successfully within ten years .
You should know that this class , which was only in the second grade , was already far behind in reading and arithmetic , compared to their peers in the Upper East Side in New York .
Because they never got the necessary encouragement .
But these children had a goal , and they knew , that they were getting the support to reach this goal , mainly from this young woman from Los Angeles .
And behind this young woman stood an organisation , Teach For America , which helped her so that her class can reach this goal .
This is Steffen .
Steffen went to a secondary school in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg .
And Steffen was lucky .
Not only was he highly intelligent , but he also had a teacher who recognised his potential and spoke to Steffen and his parents , about whether he had the possibility to do his school leaving exams , in order to move on from secondary school .
And that is what Steffen did .
It wasn 't particularly easy for him to go to a grammar school in a completely new area , surrounded by children from a completely different background .
And on numerous occasions he wished he could get some information about how it was all supposed to work .
How was he supposed to pass his school leaving exams ?
He was successful , and he is now an engineer .
He then worked for a very large German company and , among other things , set up power plants in Azerbaijan .
All under his supervision .
Our former secondary school pupil Steffen , from whom no one would have expected this .
And after a few years in this company , Steffen decided to do something else , and applied to Teach First Germany .
And he went back to a secondary school .
And he stood in front of a class , which you can see down here , and Steffen thought that there is a lot more talent here , than what we had imagined .
And he founded the Abi twenty fifteen Inc .
In two thousand and ten he started working with a group of pupils on how they could complete their school leaving exams and start studying .
And this summer he accompanied them to their secondary schools .
And now Steffen is looking forward to the end of school exams celebration in two thousand and fifteen with his former students .
I am sure that they will make it .
This is Stefan and Fiona .
Stefan is a political scientist , and Fiona is a Doctor in Mathematics .
They were both placed at the same school in Wedding , in Berlin .
And they both made sure , that out of the previous two out of sixty secondary school pupils taking the intermediate school-leaving examinations to have passed their maths exam , now twenty were passing .
And this has led them , along with other experiences they gained during their two years of working with Teach First Germany , to now create their own school .
Specifically , a private school in Wedding , where there is an approximate migrant quota of almost ninety percent and a high school graduate quota of at most ten percent .
Stefan and Fiona are already working on setting up this school .
And their goal is that pupils who could never in their life afford to go to a private school , would now be able to .
And they make a deal from the first day with each of them , that every pupil who attends the school , will leave with a secondary school diploma .
And these are the exact same students , who are currently going to school in Wedding .
And I am certain , that they will both make it , even if there is a lot of work ahead of them .
How did we make it possible , or how did I make this possible , for all this to happen ?
I came back from the US and I was very enthusiastic about this idea and had complete faith in the fact that deprived areas and educational qualifications don 't need to be a contradiction , but an absolute possibility .
And I thought that the concept which I had found , was absolutely perfect for that .
So I went off and I conducted interviews with headmasters , education authorities , foundations , organisations , graduates and newspapers , to tell them about it and to infect them with my enthusiasm .
I would like to tell you about only one of those many many interviews I conducted , but which I find exemplary .
I was sitting with the interim headmaster of the then RÃ¼tli School in NeukÃ¶lln and I told him about a fictitious Steffen and a fictitious Fiona , whom I still hadn 't met at the time , and I asked him how he would feel if such a person came to his school in two years time .
And then he looked at me and said , great , fantastic , wonderful .
But now , dear Mrs Landsberg , we both need to wake up , as there is no way that could happen in Germany .
Firstly , you would not be able to find such a graduate , because who would be prepared to come to NeukÃ¶lln for two years ?
It would be complete madness , as they could do something much better with their lives .
And even if you managed to persuade some of them , that it would be poss or that it would be fun , or that it would make sense , then you would never be able to get passed all the educational red tape in order to permit it .
And anyways , who is going to pay for it all ?
That was the starting point in two thousand and seven , when I started conducting the first interviews .
And I was so convinced that this really was the right thing to do , that I said that I wouldn 't apply for a job after graduating , but I would apply for money , with which I could create a team that would be able to make this possible .
And this is what we have done and achieved within two years with lots of patience and effort and lots and lots of luck .
In two thousand and nine we sent the first Fellows to the schools , in Berlin , Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia .
We not have around a hundred alumni , like Fiona and Stefan and now Steffen , who work on their own ideas on how education can be changed , or who work as executive consultants or as administrators .
And now we have already chosen the fourth year group and we have nearly eighty Fellows at work in Germany .
And of course , a lot of things happen to these Fellows during their work .
Not only do they support their pupils , but they also undergo a change themselves .
And it becomes clear to them , that these successes are possible and that the children and young people in deprived areas have so much more potential that was previously thought .
And these Fellows help us to realise our vision .
Every child in Germany gets to graduate from school , which then makes it possible to go through successful professional training .
In every school in Germany , pupils should develop into independent young people who learn to develop their full potential , and regardless of their origin should take responsibility in society , guided by their strengths and interests .
That is our goal and that is what we want to implement .
Today , my role models are called Steffen or Fiona or Simon .
And I want to ask you , if you would like to be such a role model as well .
Thank you very much .
ï»¿ Yes . Hello .
I must say , starting off is not so easy .
Well , first of all this wonderful concert , then the story , about how one comes to a crafts enterprise to the art area .
I would never have thought this were a craft in the past .
and now I 've come to the theme of mobility , technology , steel .
So all those things we don 't consider evening entertainment in our daily lives .
Actually I 'd wanted to start off on a more theoretical note .
We 'll leave it out .
I 've heard some of your conversations .
It 's a great honour for me to be standing in front of such an audience and being allowed to speak at an event like this .
Thank you again .
Normally there are more technical presentations .
Mobility of the future .
So my introduction .
I spoke to a few friends about this recently .
More for fun .
And there were a few really brainy people there .
I 'm not being cynical , they were really brainy .
Which Unlike me , that is .
So what was really the greatest invention of our time and what moves us and what changes us .
And we agreed on that quickly .
If you go back in history .
Because it will probably be something with the wheel .
And with the wheel we couldn 't agree on how long that thing has actually existed .
We couldn 't agree on that .
One of us won .
It 's only been around for about six thousand years .
It 's not clear where it was first invented .
But an exciting anecdote was revealed , which none of us , bar one , was familiar with .
Up until the post-Columbian time , so when Columbus went to America , there had been no wheel in North America .
That 's exciting when you think of the traffic situation in North America .
So apparently they wanted to catch up with what they 'd not had for four thousand years in the last fifty years .
I 'd like to perhaps start at the beginning with the theme mobility , energy , health , environment .
Many of these themes concern us .
When it comes to mobility , you often think of the car , of one 's individual mobile behaviour .
But that 's not the case here .
The theme mobility , personal freedom , has a narrow context .
Freedom to travel , the possibility to go somewhere .
Whether it 's with one 's own vehicle , with public transport , with an aeroplane or car is entirely irrelevant .
It always has something to do with how advanced society is , how mature and free these individual themes are .
And the other way round , even if you want to withdraw from this personally , if you say , to hell with the car , I 'll go to the next supermarket on foot , it has to be clear to you that the things in the supermarket have been delivered by train or truck .
Independently of where I come from .
The topic has a rather big , broad impact .
And you have to confront this broad impact .
It 's not enough to look at it individually .
And this is exactly one of the most important points , which will be much more significant for us in the future , much more than it is at the moment .
An important point here is , to just show one example .
It already depends very strongly on how we move about .
And not so much on what the machine uses up .
At the moment the mantra is along the lines of using up as little as possible when making a car .
Or the change to electromobility in the first place , which cannot be objected to .
But if you , let 's take an example here , CO two , which everybody is talking about and is currently being discussed intensively in Europe and is being implemented by the legislature .
Then you 'd be at about seventy percent with a fuel or petrol engine , in terms of the car 's use , during its lifespan , the amount of CO two it emits .
Twenty five percent goes to the manufacture of the car .
So about half , let 's say .
Let 's not look at it in such detail .
There 's no need for that .
Five percent is basically if you re-use everything .
If you 'd calculate that for an electric car , it would look very different .
With an electric car you 'd just have twenty five percent , as long as you 're generating electricity with coal , which the car emits because of the wave of energy , but you have well over fifty percent in terms of production .
From the batteries , the electric motors and all those things .
And if we don 't start looking at this entire cycle , we may feel relief to some extent , but we will shift the problem .
We will shift the problem to production and , from there , even outside of Europe possibly .
That 's why it 's very important to consider that the point is how sustainable production is , how sustainable the products are and how sustainable the materials you make all these things from are .
And this is where , mind you , a material comes into play , which , between quotation marks , affects me personally and intensely , and that 's the topic of steel .
In itself , this is nothing new or sophistic .
And in many cases one thinks , what can still be of any interest there ?
This is a very special background .
There is hardly any area of mobility which is not strongly saturated .
Whether it 's public transport , the railways , electric motors , whatever .
An important point is that if we manage to really recycle everything , we will generate a resource cycle , in contrast to other materials , that is really one hundred percent closed .
Steel , every car , every aeroplane , fifteen percent of an aeroplane is made of steels , will be able to be recycled with the same quality .
That means I can always make the same thing from it again and again .
This can be done with other materials too , but usually not one hundred percent .
You always have to add something to it .
If we manage to use up less and recycle more , we 'll be able to gain a lot here , because every time you disintegrate something and somehow process it you also use up energy and other things .
And that 's one of the main themes .
And like I said in the beginning , it 's the theme of material and these are the themes of this new time which are coming to us , which will affect every one of us very strongly , and which will already gives us possibilities that we didn 't have some years ago .
Who of you could imagine twenty years ago standing in Vienna , checking your mobile phone to see if there was some car-to-go or some other car in the area , going there , getting in the car , driving two kilometres and then getting out again ?
It would have been unimaginable .
The car is not even different .
The Electrosmart or Dieselsmart car that 's standing around is basically still .
These are things that have just now started to be put into operation .
They 're on the rise just now .
There are many more possibilities here .
The possibility to get into the car from the bus , onto a bicycle from the car , and onto an aeroplane from the bicycle .
It would already be possible now to have the transport mode of my choice for individual traffic , exactly at the moment when I need it .
The only condition is that everyone makes a contribution and invests something in this .
There are a number of things here that may seem incredible to some people , because our ability to adapt is so slow .
An automobile like that is really a never-ending story of mistakes .
If you can imagine Gottfried Daimler with his wife , I think , it was in eighteen hundred ninety-two or etcetera he built the first car .
That was a little wooden coach with an engine at the back .
The reason why this little engine was at the back was that if it stopped working you could attach horses at the front .
It took fifteen years for the first car to be built with an engine at the front .
It took fifteen years before we were no longer afraid that we might need the horses at the front .
Now I don 't want to go back to digital media and ask you how old Google and co. is .
But it takes a while for us to adapt .
And the same applies here .
But we can increase this speed of adaption .
And we should increase it .
Because otherwise we won 't get a grip on the problems .
Especially because mobility cannot be slowed down .
Now you can say that it will go down a little in Europe .
And it is , in private transport .
But it 's doing so half as much in goods traffic .
Every order made at Amazon , every online shop that travels up in the air somewhere , has an incredibly long logistics chain that gets one truck after the other , one train after the other moving .
And now you could say , okay , I could buy less online and I could stop using these things .
But that won 't happen .
You know that you only change when you 're put under extreme psychological pressure .
Very rarely does one do so voluntarily .
Well , I don 't know anyone who fundamentally changed themselves voluntarily .
And that 's why it 's so important to use all the possibilities that are there .
And to try out and do these things .
Things take a long time sometimes .
But a topic we should be proud of .
And I have three kids .
Luckily they 're not here , because they wouldn 't sit here so well-behaved .
And be so kind as to support me .
They would say very different things .
You 'd laugh at that point too , but I wouldn 't .
But when I 'm an old fart one day and they look back on the time when I was able to change something in my company , they will ask themselves whether I was proud of this time or not .
And this means we want to guarantee full mobility and we want to leave behind a fully intact planet .
And those are the two things that can be changed .
Independently of what side you 're looking at the whole thing from .
The reason that that 's so important is that we have a certain amount of materials at our disposal and we will be getting a certain amount of new materials .
There 's no question about it .
Because we don 't have enough of all these materials at our disposal .
That 's like if I would say that I 'm in a lightweight construction and there are amazingly great new materials like carbon .
If you can create those with hydraulic power , they 're theoretically also environmentally friendly .
Problematically we will never have a triple excess of energy on this planet , which would enable us to build practically everything out of carbon .
So everything has its pros and cons and only a good connection between these topics will help us .
Two years ago first developments were being made in the welding of steel and aluminium .
The word didn 't exist .
Twenty years ago nobody was doing research into that .
It was like , why ? You don 't really need that .
It will only be overly expensive and not help us in any way .
And the same goes for high velocity and other issues .
We have examples here already , of things that weren 't possible in the past that are now possible and they are less than three years old .
And that 's one of the most important points that I 'd like to pass on to you here .
Because everybody can do something .
And with that I don 't mean I 'm going to the supermarket on foot now to buy plums from Venezuela .
But everybody can pay attention in his profession to how they can , on the one hand , guarantee that mobility , which we all deserve and worked hard for , is limited just a little and how can I , through that , stimulate other things .
I 'll give you an example with the Swiss railways , which some of you will probably know .
The Gotthardtunnel has been in construction since nineteen ninety eight , ninety nine , I think .
They 're digging fifty seven kilometres into the mountain .
It will be completed in two thousand seventeen .
This tunnel through the mountain will shorten the travel time between Zurich and Milan by one hour .
Together with the other tunnels that pass through there they will gather up a speed of two hundred and fifty KPH .
And that 's only possible because they 're on high-speed rails that have a surface that is twice as strong .
Because you can 't change the rails every five years in a tunnel , like you can out in the open .
And it all happens electrified .
That means you 'll get into a situation where you 'll not destroy the landscape with electric drive in tunnels or other areas , and yet you 'll be as fast as aeroplane .
Because by the time it 's over the mountains in Zurich and back down again in Milan , if they ever get there and nobody 's striking , you will have arrived there by train twice already .
You won 't need to check in and take off your shoes at the station .
So there are already possibilities that are in there .
And you mustn 't make the mistake of always just filtering out one slice .
One single slice won 't get us anywhere .
It won 't help us .
To give you an example , that 's a security issue .
We 're already working on intelligent materials , so-called intelligent steel .
That 's nothing but , if you imagine this vision .
You all know airbags and other things in your car that can prevent you , hopefully prevent you , from hurting yourself badly and even from dying .
Now think what it would mean if it wasn 't the airbag , but the car itself .
If the car body were able to change its material structure in such a way that it becomes very hard very quickly and then soft again the moment it notices that it 's going to crash into something .
We 're already working on developing this structure in such a way that it already changes mechanically .
That means it changes .
If it gets into a crash , it notices it needs energy and the material changes .
In South Korea , that was a good example , in Seoul , there were deflectors that are two hundred and fifty kilometres long .
They have an extremely well-developed railway network over there .
The frog turnouts are self-curing in the middle over there .
Well , that 's the part that wears down most .
Every time a train rides over it , it gets harder .
That means it tries to work against the circuit .
This was a development that took eight and a half years .
Four people worked on it .
Goods , I think , don 't know how much money was put into it , not much .
And it was a really big issue .
And the other issues are .
Even if you just say you could develop material where you need less material , which is lighter and harder .
So-called press hardening of steels won 't mean anything to you now .
I had a few examples hung up outside .
Those are things that improve safety .
They reduce the weight .
By between forty and one hundred kilos .
A comparison , forty to one hundred kilos , the Golf seven was just released , that means about zero point four litres less consumption .
For the entire life cycle , with an average driver , that means three million tons CO two .
Three million tons CO two , just because this clunker , between quotation marks , I mean , this beautiful car , excuse me for this expression , simple has forty kilos less or one hundred kilos less .
And then you take cars of which a few million are built every year .
You will know that we have fourteen million cars in Europe .
We have sixteen in North America and China has also reached the fifteen million mark .
Think of the crank you still have inside it , if you want to add something on this side here .
And these are the things where , in each individual case , we look at whether it can be changed , whether it can be improved , whether it can be looked into again .
Whether we can make it from the material side in such a way , but if so , do the other thing too and one can link it up tighter , then we will find solutions that we don 't even dare to think up yet .
Like colleagues of mine wouldn 't have up with the idea ten years ago , that there are railway tracks today that can support a speed of three hundred and eighty KPH in China .
And they 're operating .
And these are things that weren 't imaginable .
And why is that important ?
I mean , will China have such a big need for poor farmers who travel at three hundred and eighty KPH .
No , because over there , there is the possibility that the train will lead the aircraft to stay on the ground .
Now I 'm not against the aviation industry , but it is a more efficient possibility in some areas .
And five , six years ago that still wasn 't imaginable .
And , to finish off .
The most important area and the message in all of these individual projects is that we must start looking at the entire valued added chain and the entire life cycle .
There 's no sense in me saying I need less energy or that doesn 't cost me anything , but the thing that needs less energy is extremely complex , consumes a lot of resources , uses a lot of energy and may not even be recycled .
There are parts of Nevada where a thousand aircrafts stand .
In these thousand aircrafts are million of tons of silver , gold and other things .
There is no technology that can recycle them properly .
And if you activate this recycling mode , you can make incredible things happen .
And I think that 's one of the most important messages if we manage to do that , the recycling theme , if we take a closer look at the materials we work with , and not only the work conditions , what kind of global impact does it have ?
What does it do with it ?
Under us there are irons in the crust of the earth , which has an iron core , you will find plenty of it .
It 's problematic if you say , it 's exactly under this spot here , then we clear up the area and start digging into it .
So it doesn 't have to also be rare for one to think about how to excavate it ?
And it is exactly this commitment of every individual to look at every single part and to do this collectively , that would be my personal vision and my wish for the future .
And that 's why I 'd also like to thank you for your .
Thank you .
Right , I wish you a lovely afternoon .
I 'm here today to tell you why energy moves the world .
The previous speaker painted an impressive picture of what we can do with mobility today and what we 'll be needing in the future , to further improve the living standards we are used to having .
We live in a beautiful world really . a world in which one point six billion people live without electricity .
Day after day .
If you look at the figures , at how humanity has developed over the last decades , you will find some very interesting facts .
In this chart here you can see how the world population has developed over the last years .
While it was one billion people in eighteen hundred , today just under seven billion people live on the planet .
Today , eighty three million people are born every year on this planet , and every day it 's just under two hundred and thirty million people .
And in the time I 've been standing on this stage , one hundred and fifty eight people have been born .
And per second two point six to three people are born .
People who need energy .
And if you look at that , at how this has developed in the course of time , then you will come to the conclusion that about two hundred and fifty million people have been born into this world , on this planet , in one thousand six hundred and fifty years .
And in the two hundred years that followed it was five hundred people .
And if you look at the next eighty years , it was one billion .
Then in the next forty years it would be two billion and in the last thirty nine years four billion .
And if it goes on like this , we 'll have to seriously ask ourselves where this energy is supposed to come from .
Especially if you take into account the one point six billion people who still don 't have electricity .
And taking into account the emerging and developing countries that by far do not consume the same amount of energy that we in Europe or in the Western world do .
If you look at the energy graphic at the same time , then you 'll see this image .
An image that illustrates that energy consumption has doubled in the last forty years .
And if you take a closer look , these are all fossil fuels .
This is an image that depicts the world population and energy .
The lower line , the more evenly ascending line shows how the world population has developed .
And the more steeply ascending line represents the energy consumption .
That means that if you just look at the last fifty years , you had two point five times more energy increase than people on this Earth .
That presents us with the second problem .
Is the rising world population the issue or is it the energy issue or the balance in-between ?
What do we need this energy for ?
There are three basic reasons .
One of them , as the speaker before me already mentioned , is traffic .
We need more than thirty percent for traffic .
For logistics , for the transport of ourselves and all the goods and services we need .
The next thirty percent , I mean twenty seven , just under thirty percent , is used for industry .
To produce those goods that we consume day after day .
And the final third approximately , so just under twenty five percent , goes to all our households .
That means that every one of us , so all people who live in a household in this world , consume approximately on third of the world 's energy .
And how do we consume it ?
These are amazing figures .
Just under eighty percent , to be more precise , it 's seventy eight percent that is used for heating .
Another eleven percent comes from the issue of hot water , and the rest is electricity for TV , fridge and those sorts of things .
That 's just a fraction actually .
So a good ninety percent of all that 's consumed in the household is heat and hot water .
And if you now look at building construction technology in the last years , you 'll see that we 've been putting a lot of effort into decreasing this type of energy consumption .
The red lines show how much we consume for heating with different types of energy .
The first bar represents the buildings we have in the world at the moment .
And on the far right you have the passive house .
And in-between you see a few variants .
And here you can see that from the existing standard buildings to the passive house heat consumption must be reduced considerably .
And the journey hasn 't come to an end yet .
The future should go in the direction where the house itself consumes the energy .
A house that supplies energy for the network , so that others can use it .
The question is , the energy that we consume , what does that consist of .
And here you 'll see a very shocking picture .
Just under ninety percent of this energy is generated from coal , gas or oil .
That means we 're living in a fossil fuel era .
With all the modern things we have , the smartphones and iPads and whatever .
We 're in this fossil fuel era .
In a era , where ninety percent of the energy we consume comes from oil , gas and coal .
And these forms of energy are very limited .
Five percent of the energy comes from nuclear power .
Nuclear energy , which is known because of Chernobyl and similar incidents .
A ticking bomb basically .
And only very little , just under seven percent in this world , comes from energy that we have the most of .
And I 'd like to take a closer look at that now .
What energy is it ?
Now before I get to that , I would like to show you what the situation is with the fossil energy resources .
What will our future look like if we continue to rely on them ?
And here I have a graphic that shows how many years our supply of uranium for the nuclear plants , of petroleum gas and crude oil will last .
And there you see that uranium , petroleum gas and coal , are roughly equal , they will last for just under another fifty years .
And then these resources will have been exhausted .
I know that these figures change from year to year .
And oil companies are always telling us that the technologies are always getting better and new sources have been found and all that .
But whether fossil fuels will be around for another forty or sixty years is irrelevant .
What is relevant is that they are coming to an end .
An end that is inevitable , because of the available resources .
And the answer we have to come up with is how we will continue when that happens .
Will we be able to continue using our smartphones , and all these things we enjoy having so much today , with our cars , and just continue as if nothing had happened , and keep our living standards upright in the form that is has now ?
The answer is yes , we can .
And the reason for that is the following .
Here you 'll see what primary energy demand there is from photovoltaics , hydraulic energy , biomass , wave and sea energy and wind parks .
At the top right , this big box , that 's the photovoltaic potential or solar energy potential , which we have at our disposal on this planet .
And this little dot her , this one here , I don 't know whether you can see it , this little dot , that represents the annual world energy consumption .
Down here , world energy consumption .
You can hardly see it it 's so small .
And these other spheres , that are down , this this here is solar energy .
Here you can see the potential we have with wind energy .
This box here .
This box represents wave and sea energy .
This box represents biomass .
And this here is water , the hydraulic energy potential .
And here we see the small consumption that we need , the energy that we need .
Actually this graphic shows that we have enough energy .
Except that at the moment we 're relying perhaps on the wrong kind of energy .
The graphic below contains the same box .
But here we see the coal , crude oil and uranium potential .
So basically we could have enough energy .
We have a hydraulic energy potential .
If we would use the entire potential of hydraulic energy we have , it would make itself available for half of the world energy consumption .
We have sixteen times the world energy consumption with the biomass potential .
With wave and sea energy the potential is eighty times the world energy consumption .
Wind energy potential lies at three hundred and twenty five times the world energy consumption .
And solar energy potential is six thousand times higher than the world energy consumption .
That means we needn 't be worried about whether we will have energy in the future .
What we should be worrying about is whether we humans will get out of this fossil era soon enough and will develop into the future we need .
There are two variants here in my opinion .
The first variant is So this chart here depicts the years one thousand to three thousand .
And there you see that humans started out with wood with fire .
Then we had the first windmills .
And at some point the fossil fuel era arrived , and that increased slowly .
We are now at this point here .
Nuclear energy also came into the picture .
And now there are two scenarios .
The first scenario is that we are aware of what these fossil fuels mean to our climate , and we voluntarily abandon them .
That means the curve will rapidly go down .
Or it happens a good hundred , two hundred years later , fifty to one hundred years later , and we back out of it a lot later , because we no longer have the resources in that form .
And so we have this spectrum , where we can decide where we will be .
Possibly in the middle , possibly right at the front .
Time will tell .
And after that will come era , where technologies like wind , like solar energy will simply be there and will expand .
A renewable energy era .
How quickly we 'll allow for this to arrive depends on us humans .
And so like I showed you the chart earlier on , how at the moment ninety percent comes from fossil fuels and only ten from other renewables , it might be the exact reverse situation in the year two thousand and fifty or the year two thousand one hundred .
That ninety percent comes from renewables and ten percent from fossil fuels .
The energy demand will continue to rise .
Mobility demands will continue to rise .
New things will be invented that each of us want , as was the case in the last decades .
And that means energy consumption will continue to rise .
But we have to ask ourselves in what way it will rise .
Is the way we use energy efficient enough ?
Are we saving wherever we can save ?
Do our homes still represent a third of the energy that is consumed , or is that no longer the case ?
Or do our homes perhaps produce something ?
And the question that crops up here is what does this picture , this new picture , this new solution look like .
Just like there are smartphones and smart cars , there will also be smart cities .
Because a good half of the world population currently live in cities .
And in the year two thousand and fifty it will be seventy percent of all humans that live in cities .
And that will amount to about six and a half billion people .
So just under the number of people that currently live on this planet will be living in cities at that time .
And we will need solutions for these issues .
Solutions for creating a smart city , for creating many smart cities so that we 'll live on a smart planet .
And then it will be necessary to look at topics such as smart mobility , smart government , smart environment , smart living and smart economy .
For us to be able to do that , the most important thing will be that we humans become smart people .
Because only then will it be possible to continue to move along with such a development .
So each one of us can start with themselves .
Thank you .
Can you hear me ?
Yes , hello .
To refer to Professor GrÃ¼n , although I spray graffiti , I 'm interested in art and design .
My topic this evening is undesired communication , analogue responses to campaigns and a medium for those who otherwise have none .
The latter was a quote from the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung about graffiti or style writing in Frankfurt .
In the beginning , there was the image .
At least descriptive , as can be proven today , the first communicative proof of humans are the cave paintings , which is graffiti really .
In my opinion they were schools .
I mean , I think that ancient folks or peoples had to think more pragmatically and that 's why they didn 't make any religious pictures , just wall paintings that explained where the animals walked along or where or how one could kill a bison , where one had to strike to make a mammoth fall over .
And the whole thing , which I want to make cross-reference to tonight , is of course extremely important , because , as Frank Zappa once said , talking about music is like dancing about architecture .
It 's extremely difficult .
Style writing is a huge field , an enormous movement , which affects people from all age groups all over the world today .
So you can no longer say that 's it 's purely a youth movement , as it 's already become a fixed cultural element .
As with many things , in science too , style writing or graffiti , I will explain the difference in a moment , is all about recognition .
And I 'd like to quote the brain researcher Joachim Bauer here .
Nothing activates the motivation system in the brain so much as the desire to be seen by others .
And that 's exactly the principle behind style writing , graffiti and also advertising .
The generic term graffiti .
Can we move on with the charts ?
I think the thirty seconds are over .
Style writing is the liberation of the alphabet .
Oh right , I have to do that myself .
Sorry , thanks .
Great , sorry .
Style writing is the American variant of graffiti , which is primarily focused on letters .
That means the aesthetisation of the alphabet , the liberation of the alphabet from information content to pure design , which contends with the other .
It 's all about dynamics in style .
It 's about an achievement principle .
It is , you might say , actually
What 's dripping here ?
Something 's dripping here , I 'm not joking .
Whatever .
It 's all about the achievement principle .
That means sprayers compete with each other in a reasonably peaceful way , they contend with each other through peaceful aesthetics , through these stylistics , and this is an early work by myself , this is a newer one .
It 's a form of communication on another level , you might say , as it always is with artistic expression .
Not everything that takes place in the public space is an artistic expression , I admit .
The second point is street art which can be seen in the graffiti scene .
Street art is a consequence of style writing .
There are figures that exist as decorative elements in the styles , they are these fonts that have become independent .
And additionally , there are the stencil artists .
These are people like Blek le Rat from Paris or Banksy , who has become more well-known recently .
While style writing is the American graffiti that tends to be free of any topic and doesn 't point a finger at social issues , you could say , the works by stencil or street artists can be seen as having more of an advertising quality or , yes , point a finger at social issues , so it 's tainted with social issues .
Style writing is not anarchy though , despite everything , but follows a a non-commercial parallel hierarchy that has its own values and judgements in the public and private sphere , which are the transmission spaces , you might say .
I 'd like to quote the philosopher Paul Watzlawick at this point .
One cannot not communicate .
And that goes for style writing too of course .
It 's a struggle for recognition .
It 's a struggle for communication , that can be seen , you might say , as an indicator too , or rather a muffler for social problems .
Graffiti is often found as a culture that won 't grow up in depictions in the media .
It came about in the sixties but it 's always renewing itself and so I believe it 's a fixed part of culture .
I created the artwork for the Ted X on the side here .
It 's a bit abstract , but that 's also a style , as we say , that 's a bit complaisant .
It 's also decorative .
So you see that the spray can is not only able to bring events into being .
You can look at it in whatever way you wish .
Perhaps that â€™ s also damage to property .
To look at the Internet culture in parallel , we have this pseudonymisation , if I may call it that , in style writing too .
On the Internet we have these avatars .
And these days we also have , and of course it 's also about recognition and self-marketing , about posing there .
I think it would be good , if we want to deal with these topics more openly in the future , if cities , municipalities and also institutions would familiarise themselves with this subject .
The hand that the pedagogically educated style writers , of which there are a number today , are stretching out to the institutions too should be accepted .
One should illustrate that the cultural aspect has existed for over forty years here and that it must simply yes , really be kept alive .
So , what we show , I run workshops myself .
I just have to turn around for a moment .
By the way , some of these works were made by me , some by other people .
Of course I try to pass on this knowledge that I gathered myself or that I sometimes gained from other style writers .
My work has turned me into my own brand over time and I 've asserted that the German word for brand , Marke , is based on the German verb markieren , to mark .
Of course this also has to do with the relationship to property , but the overriding thing is that that 's not so important anymore .
Where are we , where are we .
Oh right , okay .
Something that happens quite often these days , which I personally don 't like that much .
Here you can see a workshop for the Aktion Mensch charity , for example .
What I don 't think is so great is that , power companies , for example , try to stem the problematics of illegal graffiti through a kind of kitschy preventive painting , I 'll just call it that , where it 's about aesthetisations that are based on pure technique , but don 't do justice to style writing .
So here the concept of freedom of opinion is curtailed a bit .
I don 't want to go into this in any more detail , as that would be going too far .
The subject has a really large scope and cannot be completely explained in ten or fifteen minutes .
I just want to say that he who writes , remains .
That 's a terrible word really , but , in the end , what Professor GrÃ¼n said is also a lie in itself of course .
Sure , if you dare to move in an environment outside of the law and operate in the public and private sphere with a spray can , then you 're aware of your own transitory nature .
You know that you 're only here for a short time and you know that time is the only thing you really possess .
To finish off , I 'd just like to mention something Franz Kafka had to say about this .
Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old .
A funny thing in this context is that you 'll find the Schiele Museum where Tulln district court was once housed , which is where Franz Kafka had to appear on a number of occasions , because of accusations of indecency in his works .
Yes , I 'd like to thank you .
Have a good evening .
ï»¿ Yes , the topic is , close but yet so far .
What do Olympic athletes actually do , besides competing in the Olympic Games .
Actually , it comes down to ,
in principle .
Because we must imagine that there is a four-year period between two such summer Games , and these four years are almost exactly to the day .
Sometimes there are five days less , and sometimes more .
But usually , they take place every four years to the day .
This year , there were approximately ten thousand five hundred and ninety two athletes there , including all the substitutes and nominated replacement athletes and so on .
And , as you have already realised , there is a large range of emotions there , and not only due to the sports , yes .
Olympic athletes , you really have to understand this , train for four years for this .
You have to be highly concentrated .
You have to do all the preparations .
You have to forget about everything else .
You have to forget about parties .
You have to forget about your studies .
You have to forget about your relationship .
You have to forget about your family .
You have to forget about Christmas .
You have to forget about food .
Sleep .
In fact , the only thing you do is train , train , talk with your trainer about what you can improve during training , talk with your coach , who is normally in charge of mental training .
What can I improve , in order to become even better ?
And train .
That is actually your main preoccupation for four years , and then you say , yes , I 'm going there now .
I have done it , I have been nominated .
And then .
I am mentally fit and I swim my one hundred metre front crawl in this pool , and after forty nine seconds I get to the other side , that was the only competition for which I qualified and then I realise , great , it is all done .
It is all over .
this happened a lot to the Germans this year , because they said ,
enough .
Everyone can swim several times .
The Americans do it , the Australians and the British do it , the Japanese , the Chinese , they can do it all much better .
The whole swimming-several-times thing , we simply can 't do it .
And then some of this pressure is lifted off .
You are there on duty for two weeks .
Yes and now one can say , that it is a great holiday program .
Unfortunately , this is not the case .
Unfortunately , the cultural program is very limited .
There are only competitions .
And there is a big cafeteria .
And there is a park .
One could say of course , I 'll watch competitions every day .
But normally you head off at eight in the morning , and go until nine , or eleven in the evening .
It might be gratifying to watch the others compete for two weeks once you have completed your competition , but unfortunately that is not the case with most athletes .
For most of them , the pressure is taken off .
Many of them are in a relationship .
That is about thirty percent of them .
The other seventy percent are usually not .
There are different kinds of people there .
More females , more males .
Yes , and this is usually what happens .
You gather at the Olympic village in the evenings .
There are bushes there , one sort of tr tr or another , yes , bush-like trees , which make for wonderful hiding places .
You have a small room with a bed inside , which in most cases , yes , is barely ninety centimetres wide and two metres long .
It is just right for one person .
For some , unfortunately , their feet will have to stick out , I have the basketball players in mind .
Unfortunately , that 's how it is sometimes .
But then you meet in the evenings .
And then it doesn 't usually only involve meeting up and the beer that comes with that .
Which is what athletes also like to do at times .
So they drink a beer in the evenings after a competition .
After four years of being deprived of sleep , family , friends , drink , parties , the whole pressure is now taken off and you have time again .
And then someone walks over , because the person opposite has also had the pressure taken off them and doesn 't have to compete anymore , and then you go across the road .
We have already heard it being told so beautifully .
You catch someone 's attention because you have such an aura .
You can see that .
Hey , they have been liberated .
They have clear thoughts .
They are no longer focused .
They know what they don 't have to do tomorrow .
Namely , they don 't have to go to the swimming pool , they don 't have to swim a hundred metres anymore , but simply , for the next two weeks , at best , they can just enjoy themselves .
Here we have one such victim .
He has finished his competition after about six days .
This is Ryan Lochte , an American swimmer .
The second most successful swimmer in these Olympic Games .
He also took part in the Olympic Games in Beijing in two thousand and eight .
Back then , he was
His mother said that it was a real shame .
She witnessed the agony her son had gone through four years ago .
As did his girlfriend at the time .
This time , he arrived single .
This made everything much more simple for him , of course , because
That was the wrong way .
There are many females who are willing to mate at the Olympic Games .
Here we have a Russian synchronized swimming group from Russia , which is also very well-known for partying in the evenings with vodka and everything associated with that .
And on most evenings they end up someplace .
And usually in some bush , as in most cases , you don 't stay in the room alone .
So mostly , the only option is somewhere outdoors .
And then it happens .
Here we also have some nice ladies at the opening ceremony .
The Game volunteers and helpers are actually also excited by the atmosphere and are drawn in by it when they have successfully completed their tasks at the beginning of the day in the Olympic village and they also stay there , yes .
And then of course , as an athlete , going back to Ryan Lochte , you are spoilt for choice .
Who shall I pick now then ?
And so it can 't also be excluded , that one may choose more than one in the evenings .
And meanwhile , one has taken the whole some precautions .
They have taken this into consideration .
Since two thousand and four , condoms have been handed out .
There is a so-called welcome package you are given when you arrive at the village .
The mayor personally hands them out to the leaders of the delegations .
There are usually three condoms in it .
We have now made the calculations , three condoms , and there are sixteen days of competition .
There is a massive discrepancy .
That is not enough , yes .
But they have though of that , too .
The people who work at the Olympic Games are not that stupid .
They know that the thirty five thousand condoms which they put in the welcome packages are not enough .
They ordered another two hundred thousand on top of that .
And these had also , we are sorry to say , run out after ten days of competition this year .
Yes , so , one can see that the young men and ladies go completely wild .
One really shouldn 't walk alone through this park after a certain time in the evenings .
One should really be worried there , that they don 't
Yes , if you are lucky , it 'll be fine , as one says , I can live with that .
If you are unlucky , then you can 't .
But this is a frequent occurrence , and it takes place more or less every evening .
But then there is also , here for example , this family structure , because you are still part of a team , meaning , that you go back to your pack , because , as they say , it 's also good to feel as though you are part of a family .
There are also community actions .
And there like me today .
I brought Michael with me .
And now we move on to networking .
Because Michael is German , and I am going to be French today
Yes , and Micha thinks than Jochen is quite nice .
Joche is Greek , and I have had a pleasant time with the Greeks this week , like Ryan Lochte .
And then they both meet , and they both think the other is rather nice , likeable .
And then it 's the same story again , because we need a condom again .
Unfortunately , that 's what happens at the Olympic Games .
And there are more highlights with every day that goes by ,
that are then followed by endless fireworks
And there you have it .
That , on the other hand , is scaring me now .
But now we have other examples here , that a little part Games .
Here we have a British diver .
He was the star of the British diving team , or of the British Olympic team in general , it is Tom Daley .
A young man , seventeen years old , who also found his internal fire at the games , after having experienced some setbacks in recent years .
And this fire could easily reignite within him , but also for his sport and life .
But he was one of those who had to be highly concentrated for two weeks , because his first competition was on the first day and his last competition was on the penultimate day .
He was unfortunate during these Games .
Divers , it 's only fair to say , are very unlucky people during these Games , because they have to focus on the competition the whole time .
But even he can 't save himself from some screaming teens who are standing in front of his hotel , standing in front of the Olympic village and standing in front of the stairs at the location of the competition to worship him .
Because , it must be said , the British are a funny sort of people who worship everyone who is under eighteen , looks good , gets naked every now and then and performs .
And he does that in such an irresistible manner .
Last year , he became world champion in Shanghai and since then there has been a huge hype about him .
Yes , and then of course you can see him shinning after his competition , in which he was in fourth place .
And he is that kind of person , and you have to give him credit for that , and according to my knowledge , which is quite good , as his room was two rooms from mine , he received no female visitors during that time , and as far as his supervisor told me , he didn 't receive any female visitors outside his room either .
So , he belonged to the category of those nice people , who didn 't consider his fireworks and the highlight of these games to be sexual , but instead he concentrated purely on sport during these Olympic Games .
Which is also quite remarkable , and not everyone is like that .
And then the Games come to a close with a huge firework and music show in London .
And everyone , and I also think the supervisors and the athletes , are already looking forward to the Olympic village in Rio .
We still don 't have any information about that
Unfortunately , we still haven 't received any information about that .
So , they have yet to announce how many they will order for two thousand and sixteen .
But I think it will be a similar amount to the one in two thousand and twelve .
Big data . Great life .
There is this incredibly nice supermarket in the U S A , where there are no cashiers anymore .
Nobody at the tills .
And there was this great story about a woman who goes to the till and scans in all her stuff .
And once she 's done , the till says to her , congratulations , you 're pregnant .
A relatively difficult story .
It 's true , apparently .
And we 'll be looking not at till systems today , but , and I 'm from the entertainment industry , from the music industry , we 'll be looking at this subject big data , which we 're all a little scare of at the moment , because we 're thinking , oh our data , what 's happening there , we 're being pursued by Zalando shoes every day , will anything good ever come out of it .
And let 's take a look .
We don 't really need to be scared .
Maybe some of you know the film I mean the Internet is not that old , I 'm older , seven thousand five hundred days older approximately .
We 've learned quite a lot in contemporary history about what happens on an interpersonal level .
We can see for example that when when that happens , we know the shoe will end up there .
If it wouldn 't end up there , we 'd be on the Internet .
And that 's why it 's a bit difficult , let me do it like this .
That 's why it 's
We 're scared , because what will happen with it and the data and all that .
But now we 're people who say , okay the Internet might save TV .
I 'll tell you why .
What needs to be saved here anyway ?
And how can the Internet do that ?
By the way , I 'm always half full .
And I don 't mean drinking by that , but that 's why I 'm so calm , very calm , all these people here .
Right , the gla
Things didn 't always used to be better .
That 's bullshit .
Yeah , things were better in the past , I worked in advertising , we used to have big budgets .
Then I got into the music industry , oh we used to really make a lot of money .
Rubbish .
Everything could be a lot nicer , we just need to think differently .
And that 's why I say I 'm always pressing the wrong button here .
Tomorrow everything will be better hahaha .
So the way it could be is So the Internet will
I 'll make a comparison , so how should the Internet save TV .
And that 's what I 'll be talking about today .
So I 'll look at the entertainment part in this subject big data .
And from the entertainment part I 'll take the TV part and say okay , how can it be
The plague and cholera , TV and Internet .
That 's the situation .
Why is TV like the plague today ?
Ninety eight percent of Germans say their favourite pastime of all is not drinking , not having sex , no , it 's watching TV .
But I think , and perhaps I 'm mega-intellectual , I 've been sitting in front of this bloody box for ten years and it no longer interests me .
The first screen in a space has degenerated into a second and third screen .
I only turn the TV on to tune out .
I turn it on , and , how nice , I can fall asleep , isn 't that great .
Here ten forty five p.m. Arte my ass .
I have to comply to that bloody box ?
How ridiculous is that ?
And I could go on like this for another half an hour .
In the past you 'd have Colt Seavers , everybody would be sitting together in one room .
It worked .
Today I mean it doesn 't interest anyone anymore .
Was Dallas simply better than the series today ?
I don 't think so , when I look at it now .
I once studied Directing , that was in , oh well , who cares .
It no longer works .
And it 's not their fault .
It 's our fault .
We enjoy being couch potatoes .
I really love watching the box .
But it no longer works .
And if we now say , the glass is half full , let 's just take that , then what works ?
So let 's no longer grumble about , let 's say , what does work in TV ?
The simplicity .
It 's nice and simple .
Let 's take , I mean we want the Internet to save TV , let 's take the simplicity and put it aside and say , okay , we have that for starters .
The second is the Internet , which we already mentioned , it 's like cholera .
Why do I think the Internet would be like cholera ?
It might help me become very rich at the moment .
I 'm totally swamped .
With all that 's happening on the Internet .
And with what the Internet does with me .
And this amount of data , that rains down on me , is swamping me .
And that 's not only the case with the Internet , it 's like this everywhere .
Ten years ago I could still go into a cafÃ© and say I 'd like a cup of coffee , please .
And then I 'd be told , you can have a pot of coffee outside or a cup of coffee and you can sit down , done .
Pure coffee . Fantastic .
Today the following happens . I go into a coffee shop , double shot mocha cookie crumble frappuccino fat free soy frozen vanilla .
And I 'm not told , excuse me , are you alright ?
No , I get the answer , to go ?
Okay .
What the fuck ? What ha ha
What happened there ?
Are we stupid or is Starbucks stupid ?
Individualisation , globalisation , digitalisation , individualisation .
Each one of us is different today .
And yet somehow the same .
It certainly used to be every easy to make a music programme in the past .
We had two bands , the Stones and the Beatles , and that was it .
Eighty percent of people , highly individualised and so we 're slowly crawling towards what I want to get to .
Individualisation , because that 's the situation today .
We have forty five thousand music videos , and a mega number of bands .
And it 's all interesting somehow .
And they all want to be interesting .
And so we thought we 'd do the following .
With all this flood of data , we 'll just do multitasking .
That will solve the problem really .
So not us men , but certainly the women .
They can do that .
Yeah ? Bullshit .
A study was conducted that showed that when you actively engage in multitasking , your I Q is lowered by ten percent .
At that moment .
I know many women where that doesn 't matter because then they still have one hundred and thirty .
But with me it would probably be eighty .
And I can 't run a business with that anymore then .
So this , oh right And it has the same effect as smoking a big fat spliff .
So do multitasking more often .
Rubbish .
So the second solution on the Internet with all that data , so a data diet would be good .
Yes , we 'll do the following now .
Read our emails on Monday , delete then all on Tuesday , read them again on Wednesday .
That doesn 't work either , I tried it .
Quite a few people turn up and say , what 's going on with my email .
But there is some sense to the word diet .
There 's a bad sense , we know that because that 's what women 's magazines live off .
And there 's a good sense , the sense of reduction .
And that 's where we hit the core , before we go totally mad here .
I also heard that the presentation must include the words diet and burnout .
Those are the words that are most used .
I thought it was good , because it 's really true .
With all these apps and that , I I 'm really forced into this digital native role .
At some point we 'll go mad .
And we need some kind of diet here .
And a diet could be its curation .
And to take it a step further , I 'm not really interested in such a large-scale curation .
if we take the simplicity of TV and the intelligence of the Internet , yes .
And then we do the following .
We basically connect the two .
Then a personal curation gives us the incredible chance to take TV out of this boredom and create something that really interests us .
By simply turning things around and saying , why doesn 't my customer find me .
Why do I have to , just because Youtube was clever to activate that possibility , have to know everything .
I know entertainment works like that , sit down , turn on the TV , stare .
But the problem is , nothing more was being shown that interested me .
And not only did it not interest me , it didn 't interest anybody else .
Or they have to comply with it .
Because how would it be if you sit down and something , regardless of the device you 're watching it on , regardless of whom you 're watching it with , always comes that interests you .
And even if you just want to tune out .
Or you want to educate yourself , or see something interesting .
And it 's not about the right content , it 's about this feeling .
The woman is the user and the bear is the content .
This warm feeling .
I don 't know how you feel about it .
It Millions of Germans went to see that film where that boat sank .
Everybody knew what was going to happen .
It sank , they all died . And yet they watched it .
Because entertainment works .
You know more or less what you 're getting yourself into .
And then you want to be surprised .
But then you 're sitting in the cinema and thinking , oh cool , cool sound , everything 's great .
I love watching .
And then it works again .
We must consider that we now have three Internets , the plural in German is a little difficult .
It links up our previous usage of the Internet .
So the Internet is not only changing the world , it 's changing the nature of looking .
That means , on demand , so sometimes you already know , you go to Ted dot com , watch the presentation , do a search .
But honestly , excuse me for asking , can that website recommend me something I 'm interested in ?
I mean , can 't it somehow It knows me .
In terms of big data I 've been giving everything to this Internet for the past five years .
Can 't someone , I turn it on and three presentations appear , they 're curated for me .
And that 's why we connect searching , communication , social curation .
So no longer one million people found it funny that the cat falls from the tree but ten of my friends think it 's funny and recommend it .
And now the third thing is coming , and many didn 't hear the starting shot , now the entertainment net is coming .
The big networks are slowly noticing .
And Netflix are coming to Europe , Vivendi is starting up .
Entertainment is coming to the Internet in data speeds that weren 't possible until now .
I just heard it , Jojo byte .
Sounds a bit like diet .
If we connect these things together , we have the chance of finally making something appear on this bloody box that interest us .
And that works in the following way , we curate the social footprint , so the social world and smart-ass editors for all likes .
Man-machine systems .
A cash register system , if a cashier had sat there and seen that it was a man who went shopping for his girlfriend , she wouldn 't have said congratulations , you 're pregnant .
And generally the concept that you find out you 're pregnant in a supermarket would have to be reassessed .
But the idea is that the work is done behind the screen and not in front of it .
I just want to be entertained .
Sometimes you know what you want .
But we 'll deliver the soundtrack for this moment .
And that 's the future .
She didn 't even know she wanted a Berliner , even though she was in Berlin .
It was just in her .
That brings us back to power and the great presentation .
That 's what it 's about .
You don 't need to always know everything , you just have to feel it .
And then we 'll deliver it .
That that 's a bit scary , okay big data .
But let 's just grab the chance and we 'll have to take care of all the other stuff with data security and all that , but we have the chance to make things better .
Then on and always awesome .
That 's the actual idea .
And then the job will have been done .
ï»¿ Thank you very much for this friendly invitation to speak .
And of course my heart is beating , because I â€™ m wondering whether I can do this within just eighteen minutes , but we â€™ ll see .
I can â€™ t provide a technological innovation , rather it 's all about change , thinking about change , putting forth the idea that we need a fresh start , one that we can also complete , a practical one , in collaboration with one another .
When I was twelve years old , I went for a longer period to France , for the first time , together with my older brother , it â€™ s good to have a big brother , with whom you can do that , to stay in a French family for six weeks .
We were meant to learn decent French there .
Our parents wanted that .
We arrived in a small village near BesanÃ§on , Saint-Vit , an old house in the village , walked through the courtyard , and came into the kitchen .
It was evening .
A large , long table was set up there , and the parents were sitting at this table , the Italian grandmother , five of their own children , four pensionnaires , who were housed in the holidays there , and finally my brother and I were added to the mix , eleven kids in all , three adults .
We all sat at the dinner table and I remember very well , I was pretty tired from the trip , and I wondered if I would ever understand what was going on around me .
I didn â€™ t understand a word .
It was horrible .
I was there for six weeks , and then I got it .
It was a great joy to learn in this context , with this many children , this language , of which I was already familiar with a bit .
And I have to say , I also learned the joy of Europe , it was implanted very early in me .
About twelve years later , I drove through Poland to prepare my dissertation .
I took the train through Silesia and the air was totally grey , and full of sand .
It was actually very depressing .
A beautiful day , but very grey .
And I thought very wistfully , how nice it would be if this Europe could be one and we could take care of these things together , to have clean air , to be excited about the landscape and what is possible there .
And one year later , the occupation of Prague occurred .
And again , I thought , as did my friends , how beautiful Europe could be if it were not for these terrible boundaries and systemic contrasts , how diverse , all of a sudden travelling from Vienna to Budapest to Prague and back to Paris , how wonderful .
And a lot took place in Europe .
We took more and more pleasure in that , at least in Western Europe .
Of course , the effort level was quite high , but there was enthusiasm , parts of which I can clearly remember .
There was a big singing festival in Aix-en-Provence .
It was called the Jeunesse Musicales .
The choirs were internationally mixed , and at some point we visited the old amphithÃ©Ã¢tre in Vaison-la-Romaine , we sat around there , I can no longer say exactly how many , but we were probably at least three hundred , four hundred people in several choirs , and we began to sing various things .
It was such a wonderful feeling , it was such a joyful feeling .
This all represents Europe for me .
Yes , and Europe coalesced more and more , it came together , the Europe of various nations , it went through crises , sure .
Crisis became the norm .
But it continued , in part because there were politicians , who were really attached to Europe , who really wanted to achieve something with Europe , who wanted it to advance .
In Nineteen Eighty-Nine , the iron curtain opened up , and it continued .
Now I â€™ ll pause for a bit and say , that now we â€™ re involved in the biggest crisis ever .
It â€™ s a major crisis that can be so dramatic that we do not always remind ourselves of that .
And I think it is because these different nation-states that have come together always legitimate themselves in their national contexts , and the politicians think they have to tell them what they want to hear , those who have elected them , that is , and they need to act as if they were only concerned with national benefits .
This is a great misfortune in the structure of Europe .
And we can see in this moment that this misfortune is becoming more tangible .
It is the same problem everywhere , this national legitimacy .
But Germany currently has a special responsibility .
And in Germany , in the current Germany , the illusion has been fostered that we could move forward on an island of privilege , without having to take care of the others and without thinking about whether we are acting in solidarity with them or not .
A turning point must be set here so that we can make a fresh star t .
This will not be possible , given the old structure .
I can see that now already .
Instead , a new structure will be required .
And this new structure will correspond to the fact that we do not live in national conflict , but that we have other problems .
That these problems have to be solved across national borders .
That is , the remedy of the present crisis , which is first and foremost an economic crisis , which is a national one that has also become a cultural one , must come from society .
For the governments legitimized by national elections are obviously not capable of progressing without help from society .
They cannot be abolished .
I know of no alternative to this political system .
But the way they run now , governments are increasingly running against one another and not with one another .
And Germany takes on a special responsibility here , because we are still in an exceptionally strong economic situation , though we do not want to help and though nationally , at the national government level , we do not want to help .
I say this very dramatically .
When the crisis started , we said that met the legal conditions of Maastricht , each nation must always help itself out of its own mess .
No bailing out .
But this is exactly what will not work .
Only when we realize , here in Germany , that the current crisis must be mastered together , only then will it work .
My impression is that we are having such a difficult time because we are actually so well off .
One of the most prominent political scientists , who taught many years ago at Otto-Suhr-Institute , a Bohemian Czech Jew , who was forced to flee to America , and became a Harvard political scientist , once said at the middle of the last century , that power is the ability not to have to learn .
I sometimes say it even more dramatically .
Power is the ability to remain stupid .
Germany and the German government currently have the impression , apparently , that it still has power and does not have to learn .
But it needs to learn from those who do not have so much power , to learn that we need to stand together , that we need to stick together to overcome problems .
It â€™ s the same as at the national level , when the financial problem started , two people from the government said that we guarantee you can withdraw your money from the banks .
There was , to be honest , no substantial justification for that .
It was pure bluff .
But it was an effective and necessary bluff .
This was the only way to take the steam out of the situation .
This is just what we need to do at the European level .
And it must come from society , because national governments won â€™ t do it alone .
I observe everywhere , in all responsible parties which have to submit to elections , that they can see exactly what the situation is , but that they don â€™ t want to say it , because they fear , they all know that we are in a union of shared liability , a transfer union , which is clear to everyone , but they are afraid that if they say it , they will be punished at the next election .
I think , by the way , they underestimate society .
I believe that people are much too smart to perceive what â€™ s going on , and are not so narrow-minded , and are very generous , the people are this way , if you make it clear what it â€™ s all about and what opportunities they have .
And that â€™ s what matters now , that we are organizing this from society outwards .
This is what I mean with the idea of good governance , in other words , the integration of Europe using good governance .
This means that we need to supplement our current governance , that is , our system of government , with Parliament and the executive , i.e. the government , and all of the judiciary , and so on .
From within society , we need to find basic consensus about how we will proceed , beyond legislative periods , beyond party competition and regardless of what individuals strive for after the election .
This is now the task and I also believe that we can accomplish this .
We have , namely , a number of possible projects , and collaborative projects allow people to connect the best with one another .
We see this in smaller contexts as well as in larger contexts .
Germany has announced an energy revolution .
This is a huge project .
It â€™ s not easy to do this .
But it is quite impossible without the help of Europe .
And it is actually also impossible to do it without the world .
We have a wonderful opportunity , because many are looking at us , who were first saying , well , they â€™ re actually a bit mad regarding this idea , but who then say , well , they might be on to something .
These energy sources , the sun and wind , are perhaps a little pricey now , but if we continue the process , then it will probably not be more expensive , then , on the contrary , it will be much cheaper .
That â€™ s what those who are calculating the costs are saying , at any rate .
But what matters now is that we agree about the various stakeholders , about the various groups , beyond the various individual interests .
This does not happen enough .
Among other things , because where this should actually take place in our political system , is namely in Parliament , and it is no longer debating the matter .
We have just had the great fortune that the Federal Constitutional Court has said that this cannot go on .
Parliament must be involved .
Because Parliament is the place where one can discuss different positions .
And that has a profound importance .
It â€™ s not about a fight , it â€™ s not about a row , it â€™ s not about all that .
Rather , it is important that the debate , this argumentative discussion , offers us the chance to come together and find the best possible solution .
If we suppress this , if we suppress public debate about the way we want to go , we will end up with worse solutions .
We know this from experience .
This will cost us a bit of effort and the change , the transformation that is needed is not one that we can simply introduce technologically , in a quick manner , but rather one that has to occur involving all of us .
So , this energy revolution is both a shift to another source for power , transport and heat , but it 's actually a turn towards a new form of energy from society .
Because energy is something , and we have seen this in the past , that affects us all .
With the energy revolution , we need to adopt a new form of energy , and join together with others across borders , in Europe and also beyond , of course , in order to think about how we can all , with technological means , but also with understanding , with generosity , with assistance , come to the point that we can manage this collective project effectively .
For my part , I have always had dealings with Poland .
For Poland in particular , it is currently very difficult to undertake this energy transition , for specific economic reasons .
We should not return to old prejudices again , as is currently very much in vogue , and which I find almost unbearable , but we have to look at what the interests are , where the bottlenecks are that need to be overcome , and how we can be of assistance .
But it also works with other neighbours , France is advising us , because the French have always had a very different tradition in terms of energy policy .
Promoting this shared project and showing that the energy revolution is not only a purely isolated German thing , but that we can drive it forward , together with others , represents a huge opportunity .
The same applies to all the other challenges that we face , saving resources , climate protection , but also social security .
These are all important points .
We can â€™ t try to build a continent with fifty per cent youth unemployment in Spain , Italy and Greece .
This is completely beyond question .
These are all challenges .
The other day someone asked me if it wasn â€™ t true that previously Europe had been an advantage , but today it brings us so much effort , and therefore is no longer as popular .
I would say that just the opposite is true .
We can only enjoy , or find exciting , something that really requires an effort from us .
I imagine the land of milk and honey as being pretty bleak , pretty boring .
What am I supposed to do there ?
So , bringing about effort and jointly overcoming difficulties with effort is what brings us together .
Also the debate about the correct path .
That â€™ s why I advocate that we make a change , not only in terms of energy , in the energy revolution , but a change in political culture , a change in the political system , as a supplementary measure .
So that we can join together and say , stop all the talk about some old-age provision that seems so unfair .
If you look closely , it is much more complicated .
People are not facing off against one another .
There are interest groups facing off against one another .
And tax evasion also occurs Germany , not just in Greece , at the moment to an extent which is not good , but that is not reserved for the Greeks .
It occurs in our country , too .
So , remembering that is very important to me .
We should recall the great virtues or maxims of Immanuel Kant , for what he called public spirit .
These are three maxims that are so nice and short that even I can remember them .
The first maxim is to think for oneself .
The second maxim is to always think concordantly with your beliefs .
That means not behaving in such a manner that you say to yourself , why should I care what I said yesterday , but instead remembering what I said yesterday , and I don â€™ t always have to say and think the same thing , but if I change , I must be able to clarify that and I need to be able to explain it , or else I will be completely unreliable for others and they can â€™ t understand what I 'm doing .
Reliability and trust are the most important cement in a society .
And the third maxim is to think in the mind-set of others .
To put yourself in the place of another , this is the maxim of justice .
This idea has suffered over the past three or four years in Europe , and has also been stepped upon by political celebrities in a certain sense , so much that I have often felt ashamed .
Only if you take the three maxims really seriously , including the maxim of justice , will we advance .
If we put ourselves in the shoes of Ireland , Spain , Italy , Greece , but also of Poland , then we will get further and it can even be fun .
It â€™ s a true source of pleasure .
For if we ask ourselves what really brings pleasure , happiness never comes about when you simply get everything you want .
Happiness comes when I receive something from someone else , from a truly free , unselfish solidarity .
Or if I give someone something , from a truly free , disinterested solidarity , that is to say , a solidarity that does not emerge from self-interest .
This does not mean that we do not have to calculate when it comes to politics .
Naturally , we have to do this .
I â€™ m not utopian , I â€™ m too old for that .
But to bring in a little bit of this other quality is something that is very , very , very important .
And this is what I advocate .
And I tell myself , that if we can do that , to join together through various political challenges , then we can transform this old definition of power that Karl Deutsch wrote about , so to speak , not because he found it positive , but simply because he observed it , namely , that power means not having to learn , so power , to put it tangibly , is the option of remaining stupid , and we can turn this into a new motto , that power is the ability to jointly move forward .
That is Hannah Arendt â€™ s definition of power .
And although she was never a feminist , in fact , she resisted being called so , it is perhaps no coincidence that it is a female definition of power .
Jointly moving forward .
Joining together .
And not only working against the others .
That â€™ s what matters .
And I would advocate for this form of change , for an energy revolution from within .
ï»¿ The future of energy .
Energy of the future .
And taking a look back into the past .
Some facts about me .
I was born in Berlin , my father is Iraqi , my mother is German , and I grew up in Damascus , Syria .
Thank you .
And I basically started to become interested in renewable energy , which we now call sustainable energy , in nineteen seventy-three .
Some of you will still remember the so-called oil crisis in seventy-three .
Driving was forbidden on Sundays here in November .
And yes , suddenly everyone was talking about energy .
I would go to university in the mornings and be greeted by , hey Achmed , what kind of bullshit are your sheiks up to ?
Like that .
And then of course , I started wondering what was true about that , right ?
Is it really all bullshit or just politics or what ?
And I started , as I 've already mentioned , to work with solar wind and all that stuff .
People started hearing about the first developments .
At university there was the IPAT , the Interdisciplinary Project group for Appropriate Technology , which was already experimenting with some equipment .
And so on , and so on .
At the end of the seventies I took over my well in seventy-seven I took over my parent 's engineering company .
And within two years , the entire scope of projects , previously we had been working with government contracts , large industrial plants and so on , yes which we redirected , deflected towards things that can be done locally on the site .
As a first step , namely the use of solar energy for hot water .
So simple , small thermal installations .
The biggest problem I faced at the time was that the sun is an enemy .
People in North Africa , in many , every Arabic country and in many other countries also think that .
Why ?
Yes , up until that point protecting themselves from it had been a priority .
it wasn 't seen as an considered to be a positive energy source .
one of the first collectors that we had ever built .
Still relatively conventional technology , copper tubes , aluminium , but high-quality .
Well , this installation is still on our roof after more than thirty years .
It is still working .
I hope the same goes for my customers .
And then I was working in Syria until two months before the fall of the Berlin Wall .
We also conducted experiments in the field of wind energy .
This is a European patent , but this goes back to a young Iraqi engineer .
And you can see that it is a simple metal sheet , cut out from the surface .
But it is attached to two different blade roots .
And if you look at the way I am standing here now , I am not standing on one foot like a stork .
Because that is damn unstable or instable .
Funnily enough , every rotor blade on the planet , in wind energy , turbine blades , , in ventilation , ship propellers , aircraft propellers , all have only one blade root .
This means that all forces are concentrated at one point .
In this regard , the technology is much more stable , simple , cheap and it also has an efficiency factor of thirty percent and more compared to unslotted blades .
I failed miserably with this here , because the experts in Germany , to whom I wanted to present this system , said , Mr Khammas , if this were a great idea , then the our engineers would have discovered it long ago .
It is a lost case .
Then I moved on and wondered whether there were any other options .
And I started to collect and structure all of the information I could get on renewable energy .
And ultimately , it all starts with physical strength .
Physical strength is a type of energy that is available to all of us immediately and at any time , as long as we are alive .
And one shouldn 't underestimate what this , on average a quarter horsepower is calculated , what we can generate over a longer period of time predominantly , so now with a pedal over what do you call it , thigh muscles , one shouldn 't underestimate this , if you combine it with intelligence , you can get really far .
Yes , intelligence is important .
These are , for example , people from Australia , if I remember correctly , who were originally active in the field of wind energy , and they made it possible in many , many areas in Africa where there is a great demand for drinking water to at least get a tank which is also quite high , so that a conduit could be made .
You turn on the tap and there is pressure , something we are all used to here .
But how do I get the water to come up ?
Well , with child labour .
We all had such merry-go-rounds in our playgrounds , those things that rotate .
When the children race around , an unbelievable amount of energy is produced .
The entire time , as long as they don 't have any homework or something else to do , they run around , rotate that thing and simultaneously , the water is pumped up from the ground into the tank .
The children are happy and the parents let them play because everyone has something to gain .
I think this is a good concept .
The Aquaskipper is as least as intelligent .
In this part there are some short clips , I 'll show you where you can find them all later , where you can see a young man passing by a coxed four in an Aquaskipper , just using the movement of his thighs .
Basically like the trot of a horse , you always have to create some resistance too .
A bit more energy here
There is nothing , no engine , no energy , just muscle power .
You can see this is in the water , yes exactly down here , that is the bearing surface so to speak .
The only part that 's flexible in the entire thing , it only goes to and fro a bit , and is basically imitating the tail fin of a dolphin , the movement generated by this pressure , you scuttle over the water .
And anyone who 's really good at it can be wearing a dinner suit and jump onto it from the runway , go to the other end of the lake , jump back onto the other runway and not a get a single drop of water on the suit .
You would need to have done some training , but it works .
So it 's a brilliant concept on the idea of muscle power .
Solar energy , which we 've mentioned several times here today , is a thing of the present .
In the field of renewable energy it always comes first .
The sun is big , after all , we all worshipped it at some point , whether it was in Egypt as Ra or perhaps here in Europe too .
That 's a drawing of the famous story of Archimedes at the time , who used reflected sunlight to set the attacking fleet on fire .
Whether that 's true or not is unknown .
But there were several university groups that basically sim ulated the experiment and they were indeed able to set small boats on fire .
So it works , theoretically .
That was over two thousand years ago .
This is a bit more recent , a few hundred years , Leonardo da Vinci .
It appears to be a solar collector .
Today we make big things , whether it 's Desertec , huge trough power plants or the photovoltaic panels that are here in Brandenburg .
Those are dishes , parabolic reflectors .
And in this thing up here you 'll often find a Stirling , a hot air engine .
You can also come up with other technologies .
Heat is concentrated .
This concentrated heat can cause things to steam .
I have steam , I can , in turn , convert steam into electricity or something inside turbines .
But in two thousand and ten the United Nations defined this year , two thousand and twelve , as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All within the framework of a resolution on
And I 'd like to now underline this word for everybody .
Things like this are not for everyone .
It 's for a very small group of people , us basically , in the developed countries .
This is much more important .
Because exactly the same principle , absolutely , there is no difference physically , it 's just smaller , easier to make , I can imagine hundreds of thousands of garages everywhere in South America , in Africa , in Asia , making these little cookers .
It 's already happening .
There are a lot of initiatives , but it 's still far too little .
About ninety percent of all people in these respective countries , I would estimate , have never ever heard that you can cook with solar energy .
It 's no longer an issue anymore , yes it only works when the sun is shining , but the workers come home from the fields , in the late afternoon , evening , and they want to have a warm dinner in the evening .
The biggest kitchen in the world that runs on solar energy , in India , that cooks over fifty thousand meals every time I believe , is a large yoga centre that uses Schleffler reflectors .
These are basically also cookers , a little bigger , which direct their light at metal blocks , or stone blocks , and heat them for such a length of time that you can cook with it all night .
So , that 's also not an issue , also the storage , very simple means , is much more effective than the complicated types , which we sometimes come up with because of research funds .
Another brilliant idea , yes the so-called Watercone invented by a Bavarian designer , a designer from Munich .
Water , salt water , tap water , something goes in , put it in the sun , it evaporates , it drains off , and outside there is this surrounding collecting ring .
G I Z or G T Z , as it was called at the time , carried out a project of this kind in Yemen .
Ten families each had ten Watercones , and they were to prepare their drinking water with them in Yemen .
It worked .
And the people themselves said the water tastes better than the water they buy in bottles .
And let it be understood , no bottles are used here , there 's no waste , no transport costs and so on .
You can also open up an old boiler , pack away the insulation , paint it black , and then you have a good solar collector too .
So there are a number of things .
We mentioned photovoltaics already , this is something by Solar Decathlon , or whatever it 's called , so this competition , which has been running for some years now , in which universities compete against each other , for simple homes that want to supply themselves with one hundred percent energy .
Right , an aesthetically different taste , but it 's being done , a lot of experiments are being carried out .
I myself am a supporter of solar technology in the field of shipping .
This is the Solon , it 's here in Berlin .
Because the experience I had with this , also with smaller solar ships , is just great .
You set off with a half full battery on a sunny day , and if you don 't sail too fast , you 're back in the late afternoon with a full battery .
Try that out with your car .
I mean , the fact that simple energy resources exist , and in so many forms too .
Back to my story .
Wind energy .
These machines in Persia as mills , two and a half thousand years old and they 're still around .
They look exactly like the model here in the German Museum .
Some of them even still work .
That 's amazing , isn 't it .
And a very modern vertical axis doesn 't look any different .
Mind you , this involved man-years of development work and what have you .
Of course it 's more efficient , more economical and that , but as for the principle .
I mentioned IPAT a little while ago , they designed an oscillating-wing wind power generator for the Third World , where a vertical pump can basically be used .
In the other direction there are the Flettner rotors , they were created by Enercon , the big E SHIP one , developed for offshore plants .
But they used Flettner rotors .
I don 't want to explain the physics behind it , you can find that on my homepage , but it 's a very interesting system .
The surface area of the cylinder can be increased in your mind , the ten-fold surface area in the form of a sail , then you 'd have the equivalent of how effective they are .
And it 's the first ship to have been built in recent history with this technology .
Water , the next important resource .
These are the oldest machines on our planet that are still turning .
In Syria , on the Orontes river , in Hama , the Roman norias .
Of course the wood is replaced in part every ten years , when it starts to rot .
I asked the people too , and the axle , which runs over stone , smeared with water so to speak , they say , must be replaced once every generation .
But it 's hydraulic power .
Water is lifted for irrigation , in the past it was also used to supply a city .
We spend a lot of money on wave power plants , huge things , Pelamis in Portugal , hardly heard anything about it in the last one or two years .
They swim and are then supposed to produce electricity in their , well , limbs , via hydraulic power .
And they do .
I don 't know if it 's the right way .
But I collected all systems , and they are one of them .
A very interesting system from Austria , a gravitation water vortex power plant .
Instead of the water just flowing vertically and a turbine moving , it has a spiral movement , and sputters off here .
And I thought it was great that the inventor , ZotlÃ¶terer , put the very first system that he built , which is now four or five years ago , on the market immediately with an output of fifteen kilowatt .
How many research projects take years before something comes out of it , and this man did this on his own initiative .
Here you see the vortex on a small one to ten scale , how it is pulled in and goes out again at the bottom .
And finally you put in the turbine , the generator is at the top in the box .
So you have easy access to the generator too .
Repairs are easy .
This can be very easily made in the Third World .
Energy storage is very important .
Energy storage , battery , Wolter , Middle Ages here or the Age of Enlightenment , no .
two thousand five hundred years .
Parther , Iraq , the battery of Bagdad .
Can be seen at the museum over there , was probably used for galvanisation .
So there are predecessors everywhere , there too , there are old systems everywhere .
Like I said , I 've been collecting the material since seventy-three , then I started a homepage in two thousand and seven , where I worked on all this material .
Very quickly , the layout , here 's the menu , at the top is the trailer with Arabic and English subtitles .
The five parts can clearly be seen on the sitemap here .
Ecology , my tools , here all the different renewable energies .
I recommend clicking on the table of contents first , because you should scroll through that , so you know what you 're getting yourself into .
This is my favourite machine , one can have that , and here at the back the individual element , so to speak .
Part C can be found in the menu on the site , and it opens .
I found my energy through this man .
I met him in Syria in nineteen hundred seventy five .
He presented , well , an innovation of his , which totally inspired me .
It goes a step further , the old screw , Archimedes ' screw , which is the attempt to keep the whole thing upright somehow .
But nobody 's ever managed to make water flow upwards perpendicularly .
We managed to .
You all know it works .
In Tintin this whirlpool also works very high up .
Has it been longer than fifteen minutes ?
That 's what the machine looks like .
You can find all the other information on the homepage .
Thank you for your patience .
