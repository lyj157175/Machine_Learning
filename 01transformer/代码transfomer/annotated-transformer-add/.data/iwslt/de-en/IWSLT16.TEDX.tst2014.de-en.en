Well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
Thank you very much for having me here today .
And now I have to present myself by myself .
My name is Christian Kromberg and I am a councilor , weird word , of the city of Essen .
These are so-called elected public officers for eight years .
And my tasks include : first , personnel , second , organization and third , public order .
Thus , I am responsible for the parking tickets in this city .
And yes , like that you don't become popular .
I know .
Furthermore , and this is something that my son especially likes , I am the head of the fire brigade .
Which means that I am the chief of the fire brigade of Essen .
Seven hundred and fifty professional fire-fighters and five hundred volunteers .
And thereby I thought about one important topic with which I want to confront you today .
It's the topic of disaster control , because also this is part of the fire brigade .
We hope for the best and prepare for the worst , that is what Jack Welch once said .
You know him .
He worked at General Electrics .
And then I start saying something a bit less serious .
I will explain a situation to you .
That is how we call it when there is a risk , when a catastrophe is imminent , for example the main station of Essen , rush hour .
A lot of people are on their way .
It gets crowded and accumulates .
And somewhere at the edge is a suitcase , lonely , abandoned , a bit worn-out , maybe plastered with stickers .
Nobody seems to belong to it .
Nobody owns the suitcase .
Suddenly an announcement .
Please leave the area of the train station .
The police comes , the fire brigade , emergency lights .
People shout .
Officers yell .
Please go out .
What's going on , passer-bys ask .
We don't know or we are not allowed to tell you .
The people leave the building .
Children cry .
Some even fall since everything has to go quickly .
Suddenly a rumor .
It contains poison gas .
Panic breaks out .
I will stop here .
The rest is up to your imagination .
However , it is no phantom of imagination what I told you .
This is exactly what happened this week in DÃ¼sseldorf .
Such a suitcase was left there .
Afterwards , it turned out that there were nothing , in inverted commas , but nine kilograms of drugs inside .
But the people were pushed out of the building in the same way , a friend told me .
They were told nothing .
And exactly this rumor suddenly appeared at least in the group of my friend .
Thankfully no panic broke out otherwise the whole situation wouldn't have ended that harmlessly .
You see that in a crisis situation , in a starting catastrophe , communication is a very important good .
Communication is important because the people in this situation long for communication .
They want to know that is going on .
Earlier in the good old days , it was easier for the authorities .
We just didn't say anything or lied .
Why ?
Because the so-called panic myth prevailed .
One has justified by saying that , oh my Good , the people will panic , so it would be better not to tell the truth or to tell the untruth .
In a time of social media , in a time of Twitter , in a time of Facebook , in a time of private and public broadcasting companies , in a time of private and public television this is not possible any more .
Plain and simple because first , it is not ethical and second , we as an authority are most of the time the last ones who report on the events .
You may remember the plane crash in the Hudson River some years ago .
The first announcement came via Twitter .
From someone who was on a ferry and plain and simple immediately tweeted , a plan had crashed here and we are saving the people now .
This wasn't communication of the authorities .
As you can see we plain and simple need to tell the truth right from the beginning on today and to provide a lot of information .
Because most of the time we are the last ones who are supposed to know the truth , because we as authorities have to check that we do only spread reliable information .
Public media or also private media are either not as bound to this as we are or they just don't do it .
Therefore , we in Essen , and this is something that has already dominated the media , have thought about how to deal with disaster communication in the future .
And therefore , we will get out the good old horn .
However , only as a medium for the first communication .
This means that in the following years , we will install about one hundred horns in the city region which , some of you may still know it , will start blaring in the case of a catastrophe .
In former times that was it .
You know , maybe you remember what the signal three times short , one time short , one time long and one time short means .
I don't know it any more .
Today , we want to combine this with all communication possibilities we have , such as multimedia , via Facebook , via Twitter , via the radio of course and even at night , via television and in general via Internet and the local media and so on and so forth , connected of course with telephone switchboards in order to finally transfer the information .
And we know that we have to act fast and thoroughly and we know that we have to inform fast an thoroughly because otherwise we will irritate the citizens .
And they will finally not believe any more what we want to tell them .
Thus , communication during a crisis in one the one hand a question of rapidity via all media we have and it is a question of trustworthiness .
Trustworthiness is our biggest problem because either the citizens say , well , they are just exaggerating , it is not true , they lie and everything is worse than it is in reality .
We have had a positive experience with Facebook and Twitter , just recently .
You , some of you may have heard of this in the media .
We had a bigger find of a bomb in Essen Kray .
It was a so-called chemical bomb .
These are bombs with a long-term detonator because they should not explode when first bouncing onto the roof of a house , but glide through the houses in the second World War and only on the floor due to a chemical reaction , triggered by a small metal plate separating two acids dissolves and then it came to an explosion .
The problem is now that many pf these bomb never worked and are still lying in the city region as for example in Essen Kray .
And there an older gentleman , who wanted to , as he nicely expressed it in the protocol , ease his conscience , he saw how it came down in nineteen forty-three and now two thousand and thirteen he informed the authorities that there is a bomb .
Anyway , afterwards , many more older gentlemen in the whole city region reported this .
We will see what we will find .
These bomb do not have to be disarmed , but immediately be blown .
Thus , plain and simple we literally blew up a bomb in the Krayer Park .
And for the first time in history of the city , the whole communication happened via Facebook and Twitter with the consequence that the entire blasting operation was followed by a total of far more than sixty thousand followers .
And the media were enthusiastic .
We didn't even have to call them , they just read everything and made notes , everything via Facebook and Twitter .
The whole story had an immense effect for us since the trustworthiness was significantly higher via social media .
Simply because you have to give me a sign when I have to stop .
I cannot see the clock from here .
That is , the trustworthiness because first , these social media have the advantage that they pass on factual information .
They do not so much influence the opinion because the members tweeting there or the followers , as you call them , are highly interested in obtaining information .
Second , quick corrections .
If something is not correct , somebody will immediately write this , like that the trustworthiness I have just mentioned is much higher because the whole community actually participates in the creation of the announcement .
And it is a very high correction speed , so if something is wrong , it can be quickly corrected .
And we have a large spread .
As I said , sixty thousand who found it exciting how a bomb in the Krayer Park explodes .
Thus , we have from all the things that happened in recent years and a lot more disasters happened as anybody thinks or knows of .
Even the city of Essen can become the victim of such a disaster every day .
A bomb which has to be blown is clearly not one of it .
But it can also , and that is what we are digging for , be found in the garden of your neighbor and then we are there with our teaspoons and try to find it seven meters below ground level .
And when they , think of Munich , think of other cities , when they have to be blown because they have such an acid detonator that you cannot disarm in a conventional way , then we already know that many houses will not look the same afterwards .
And it is important to communicate this , on the one hand , because in a world of rapid communication it is necessary to communicate in order to for instance prevent the people from panicking , to take care that the people are informed , to take care that the people are capable to adapt to such a difficult situation .
And the social media also help us to be trustworthy since eventually everybody participates in communication and it does not only come from the side of the authorities as it was the case in the seventies , eighties and certainly to a large extent also in the nineties .
Thus , today , disaster prevention is not only the task of the authorities , it is not only up to the fire brigade or the aid organizations , of the technical emergency service , the Johanniter , the Red Cross et cetera , but communication during a catastrophe and the overcoming of a catastrophe concerns all of us .
And Magdeburg showed that .
There , a greater part of the help took place via Twitter or Facebook , even though we were sometimes a bit overcharged because , suddenly , lots of people wanted to build some dikes and we didn't know any more where the sandbags were .
This shows that there is still a lot to do , also for the public communication in a case of emergency , but the unprecedented solidarity with the citizens of Magdeburg and its surroundings has simply shown that disaster communication is not possible any more without the social media .
And I hope that I have convinced you a bit and that these media , that is often used for the positive things in life , can also be reasonably used during crisis and that we as a city which is responsible for the catastrophe prevention will discover it and expand it in a new way in the future for your , for the benefit of the citizens and I will finish here and say thank you for your attention even when I could hardly see the whole time .
Thank you very much .
So , good evening .
I am Sharlene Anders .
I am a writer and a director , as you just heard .
And on top of that I am starting my own production company right now .
And I'll show you in a moment what it is that I'm going to produce there .
But before I do that , I have to make some remarks .
The first thing is , I believe that we really need stories to survive .
That we couldn't live without stories .
Furthermore I believe that there are many more stories worth reading , hearing , and seeing , than are actually being produced by the entertainment industry .
Moreover I believe that really almost nobody uses the Internet , the infinite vastness , properly in a narrative manner .
And fourthly , I am firmly convinced that humans are made to be creative .
And that they are happier when they are allowed to be creative .
With more people being happy the world is doing better .
Quite logical .
Now this better world is just a by-product , however .
First and foremost I am , as I said , a storyteller .
And the story I would like to tell begins at midnight in a bar , where people are just singing Happy-birthday .
This is Alea .
And it is Alea's twenty-first birthday .
Now she doesn't notice much of the congratulations and the singing , because in the moment it has turned midnight , something happens to her .
Something is happening in her head , in her body , with her perception .
And she doesn't really have the words for it .
She doesn't know what is happening there .
But I do have words for this .
I call this the Wizard-of-Oz-effect .
You see on the one side Dorothy and Toto in Kansas and all is rather black and white .
I've got the feeling somehow my sound is very noisy .
Sorry .
And on the other side we have both of them then in the Land of Oz with plenty of color .
And let me tell you at this point that I stage and write better than I draw .
So , the first thing Alea sees now with her new perception is a strange man with fiery red hair , who stands before her , looks at her seriously and says : congratulations , you life is over .
That's Mikesch .
Mikesch explains to Alea that she belongs to a very special kind of human beings .
She was born a player .
Players are people who , from age twenty-one , have to play for their remaining life span .
How many of you know Highlander ?
Very nice .
Imagine the immortals there wouldn't draw their swords when they meet , but take game accessories out of their pocket .
That is dices , playing cards , spillikins , all sorts of things .
The really important thing is , the players do not see into their playing time .
Just like we don't know when we are going to die .
Of course I wish everybody a long life , but we just don't know .
Tomorrow everything may be over already .
And this applies to my players , too .
They have absolutely no idea just how much they can play for .
Then again this means that every lost minute might have been the last .
A player who has gambled away his whole life span goes out in the moment he loses , just like a candle blown out .
Of course , this raises the question : if it's really that dangerous , then why do they play at all ?
The answer is perfectly obvious : this .
Without playing , without players around you , Kansas , all is gray , and a player is only really alive when he is playing .
They were born to play .
So .
This story about Alea and how she is learning to know the world of the players now , facing the first challenges and , of course , inevitably falling in love with Mikesch , this is the story I would like to tell .
And that in the form of a web series .
The first season contains twelve episodes , sorry , I mixed up the digits here and noticed it too late .
So , twelve episodes in the first season , each of them five to seven minutes long .
You are familiar with this kind of storytelling , one episode after the other , in a nice unidirectional way .
Ever since the moment of its birth TV has done nothing else .
That isn't new .
And if that were all , then for one thing I would be done now .
And , besides , wouldn't be here at all .
But that's just the beginning .
Let's return to Highlander for a moment .
What's the most famous quote from the film or the series ?
There can be only one , right .
Thank you .
As if we had rehearsed it .
And that's exactly what doesn't apply to my players .
There can be plenty of them .
There are so many different games .
Just think of board games , card games , drinking games , strategy games and so on and so forth .
And the number of players is just as uncountable .
And so here are many stories , all waiting to be told .
Now the next question would be : who is supposed to tell them all ?
I do think quite highly of myself .
I think of myself as sufficiently intelligent and extraordinarily creative .
But I know that a hundred brains produce more than a single one , even if it's my one .
So immediately the idea arose to involve the crowd in the creative process .
What if we did not only tolerate or allow fan fiction , but encourage it ?
That is saying , we would like to cordially invite you to develop the plot in the world of this story .
Just image , in episode three , for example , a Mikado player appears , and you really like him because he reminds you , for example , of your grandfather .
Besides you are a big fan of audio plays .
Then you can simply , since it's not that hard anymore with modern technology , make an audio play .
Then you upload it on the platform of the project , where it is , and that's the really cool thing about this , forwarded to the part of the audience that's really interested .
That is to say , it doesn't disappear somewhere , but it lands exactly where it is supposed to land .
The really nice thing about this is that we are on the Internet .
And on the Internet you can really do anything .
That is to say , any medium is allowed somehow .
This means that you as an audience can write , draw , film , whatever you would like to do .
And if we take another look at this structure now .
Somehow this looks like a network , doesn't it ?
Like this story network that is collectively built .
And I am really firmly convinced that the Internet was born to tell exactly these kinds of stories .
Unfortunately there are not many people who do this , or rather nobody does it .
And now I even go a step further and make the spectator himself the player .
Namely in a smartphone game .
There you can compete against characters from the series , but also against people from your real life environment , who also have this game app on their mobile phone .
The buzzwords for this , I'm sure you know them very well , are something like mobile gaming and location based entertainment .
These wonderful fields that are developing rapidly at the moment .
And which I cannot go into or else I would need another twenty minutes .
Let's summarize .
Jeder-ist-mal-dran consists of three parts .
The first part is the web series , the second part is the user generated content , and then we have the smartphone game .
With this project plan I was already able to convince the jury of the , wait , I just have to read it off my notes : the GrÃ¼ndungsinitiative Innovation Duisburg .
They have awarded me the first prize for the best business plan .
And I have to say : this jury was made up of representatives from banks , from the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry , economic development agencies and so on .
So , sensible people , one would think .
And if I can convince them , with my talk about using the Internet right , revolutionize narrative structures , improving the world along the way , then I think I can really convince anybody .
So .
Jeder-ist-mal-dran : why is the whole thing called that ?
Because the name already covers all the fields concerned .
Of course , first we have the playing area : whose turn is it , it's my turn , it's your turn , everyone will get their turn .
Then of course dying .
In the series many , many people die .
Everyone will get their turn means : everyone will have to die one day .
And then of course : everyone will get their turn , meaning everyone can join in if he wants to .
That's very important to me .
I come from theater and there is nothing worse , in my opinion , than when it becomes some kind of participatory theater .
I don't know if you know that .
When you're in the theater and then the actor comes into the auditorium and everyone is like : oh God , please , not me .
And that's exactly what it's not .
So it is a voluntary interaction .
Nobody has to .
He can simply be a spectator .
The reason why I speak German is that the whole project will be in German , for the time being .
This has several reasons .
I've been taking this project around for a while now and I've been asked many times : why don't you do the whole thing in English , larger target audience , blah blah blah .
To this I can only reply : the German book market is the third largest of the world .
The largest is the English , followed by the Spanish and then the German .
So it's not like we are in some small niche .
Besides I really , really , really believe , if there are people who are like me , that these people will be grateful for something that has not been passed through some mills of synchronization , causing each pun and each play on words to disappear .
If everything works as I would like it to , then the first episode will go online on December the first two-thousand-thirteen .
And now if you wonder why I am here now at a TEDx event when it goes under the title ideas worth spreading .
I have thought about that , too .
I love TED talks .
Not only TED talks .
I'm also quite addicted to success guides and self-help books .
There were also some business guidebooks and business plan guidebooks .
And I can really just say that all that knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly inspiring .
But there is no use to it if you don't apply it .
And my project simply is something where I just took everything I have learned .
And applied it .
And it works well so far .
I can really say that .
So , if somebody thinks now : I absolutely want to contribute already , I just had an idea for a character or I've got a drawing or a cartoon or whatever , that's already possible at this stage .
You can already find us on the Internet .
On Facebok .
I like how the speakers talk off-the-cuff .
Yes , me , too .
Welcome to : is it possible to erase memories ?
I'm asking you .
Is it possible to erase memories ?
Can you remember everything that has ever happened in your life ?
Have you never forgotten anything ?
Who can remember everything ?
There are no hands raised .
So , is it possible to erase memories ?
Yes , apparently .
Thank you very much .
No , we don't want to make it that easy on ourselves today .
Because then the talk would be quite brief .
Good evening again , my name is Samuel Brodbeck .
I chose this talk tonight because it combines two of my passions or my two great passions at the moment .
I have studied computer science not far from here and happened to deal with bits and bytes , which fly around the world in great numbers nowadays .
And I have been working as a coach or a consultant in the private and professional field for quite some time now .
So on the one hand I have dealt with computers a lot , on the other hand I am currently doing a little research on the human components , that is , how does the human nature actually work ?
How can that be changed ?
The let me illustrate an analogy .
Just recently I took part in a very interesting discussion on artificial intelligence .
So , the question was : when will we be able to build a computer that works like the human brain ?
Well , and I think we have come quite close to that .
I think two , three hundred years , it won't take any longer than that .
But let me explain why this might still take some time after all .
The comparison between the computer on the one hand and our brain on the other hand .
If we consider the computer , for example , then everything , that is your smartphone , your tablet , your desktop PC , and also those cameras , and all intelligent refrigerators , is somehow based on such a little chip .
It is called CPU , central processing unit .
These components consist of tiny transistors .
Surely everyone has already heard of this word , and in circuit diagrams it is always depicted as a triangle .
It is a small component that has three terminals and respectively switches electric current or not .
In our CPU we have , I looked it up , about five hundred million of those little components .
And they are wildly switching around there .
We save things , we compute things , we have just heard Albert Einstein say , yeah , a computer can do anything , can do very much , very fast , but in fact all he can do is compare zero and one .
That's all it can do .
In fact it is quite dumb .
Let's compare it to our brain .
The smallest unit in our brain is the neuron , the nerve cell , and we have , I looked this up , too , a hundred billion of them , so there are a hundred billion neurons up here in our gray matter .
The nice thing is , though , our neurons do not only have three terminals , but they have up to twenty thousand per neuron .
And , just because it's so much fun , thus the number of terminals in total amounts to ten trillion .
That's ten with fourteen zeros .
So this shows that the complexity of our brain is already a lot higher than that of the computers we have at the moment .
If we compare the power consumption , maybe some of you know this , the first supercomputers , they had their own power station next door , the mainframes , and the waste heat of the cabinets was used to heat the campus nearby .
Sometimes our heads are spinning , too , but the processor up here needs approximately twenty watt .
And that's the equivalent of two large bananas , that's all you need , and your computer up there works perfectly .
Now if we carry around with us such a great thing up here , such a great computer , then why don't we use it , why do we forget things ?
Maybe some of you know these advertisements on the Internet , like : the human only uses ten per cent of his brain , buy now this DVD set to become a mega brain .
And I think the advertisement is a little mistaken there .
Ten per cent , yes , maybe , but in the course of evolution our brain has grown to this size , it was smaller at some point , in the very middle there is still our reptilian brain , everything else has formed around it .
Surely that didn't happen because we don't use it .
But then why does it seem like the greatest part of it remains unused ?
Perhaps you know the concept of the unconscious ?
I always compare this to an iceberg , if you look at the iceberg , in the ocean , then on top there is the tip , then the water surface , below there is a large chunk .
And these ten per cent on top , that's more or less our logical , our thinking mind , but in the background there is ninety per cent , there is a great unconscious part .
We just heard the statement , we're very slow but we're creative .
And , to return to this talk about memories , perhaps some of you know people with a photographic memory .
People who suddenly remember many more details than I have seen in a situation , you know , and then suddenly they tell you something , I said , yes , of course , but how do you know that ?
There is a special person , a so called savant , somebody with a so called island of genius , generally somebody who is brilliant in one field , who stands out , this person has such a good photographic memory , he was flown in an airplane , no , nonesense , not in an airplane , in a helicopter , he's not that fast after all , over Rome , looked at Rome , and well , Rome is not the smallest city after all , afterwards sat down in front of a giant sheet of drawing paper and started to draw Rome .
And not just somehow , here the river , and there is that , no , every single house , every single door , he looked at every single window once , memorized it , and was able to reproduce it on paper .
Now where does that come from ?
So why can he do that , why can't we do that , perhaps one could assume that person has a little more access to his other ninety per cent .
Now we do use them , but why can't I remember all the details of the menu last night ?
A friend of mine who is a hypnotist has had interesting experiences with this .
For example , he was working in criminal prosecution once and dealt with a rape victim who had completely repressed her experience , it was not present anymore , that was a protective function of the brain , that did not happen , that's gone .
Great , she could perfectly cope with that .
But now it was about arresting these people .
He was able to lead her back to the end or the moment after this incident in a very safe session , even if she wasn't able to remember it actively , she was then able to recognize the license plate of the car in which these people drove off , it wasn't parked nearby , it was fifty meters away .
And in fact , this registration number helped catch one of the culprits .
The second case I really liked was when he was hypnotizing a lady , who told him that her mother always used to read Alice in Wonderland to her when she was little , around age four .
She was sitting on her mother's lap then and her mother was reading .
And then he said to her , in trance , read it to me .
And she started reading it out , she was four when that happened , she couldn't read then , today she can .
And then he said , tell me the number of the page .
They really found a copy of Alice in Wonderland in which the text the lady had read out was on exactly that page .
So the brain had memorized the page as it was , as a picture .
After that , she was able to read it out .
So , yes , we really have access to it , but in our everyday life it seems like we have , say , some kind of protective function in order not to overcharge us .
However , now we don't memorize the event itself , but as we just said , he saw a picture there , the page of a book , so in fact what we memorize are sensory impressions , that is , what we see , what we smell , what we hear , what we taste , and what we feel , so if you all think of a yellow lemon now and how you take a hearty bite in it , then you already have an impression of what it tastes like , very popular example .
And , since it's been quite a long evening now , make yourself comfortable in your seats , feet a little erect , and then may I ask you to just close your eyes for a bit .
And think of a very pleasant , positive event in the recent past , yes .
Pick the first that comes to you .
And when you do that now , you may notice that this memory comes with a visual part .
Perhaps you get a picture , maybe even a film ?
Some people don't even notice , because it comes so normally to us , but you do it consciously for the first time .
And when you see that , you may either be in a film , relive everything through your eyes , or how you see yourself on a screen .
The first is called associative , the other dissociative .
Thank you , you may let go of the thoughts , you may open your eyes again .
Who of you has had visual information , hands up ?
Yes , there are a few hands raised , that's how it is , about a third , I'd say , yes , that's about what I expected , it's really something we do so often that in the first moments we don't even notice .
Okay , let's continue .
One thing that's also nice about memories , if you trigger memories , it's not only that memory that surfaces , but the corresponding feeling , we just had a positive event and I have seen some of you smile , that was like , yes , that was nice , there were nice yes , you laugh , and perhaps the memory is still there , in fact with our memories we also record nice feelings or other feelings .
And now there's something exciting .
All that we just talked about was , well , the at this point our brain doesn't make a difference between what we have really remembered and what we just imagine , what we picture .
This is also something you can try at home when you just sit down and imagine something in the future , that hasn't happened yet , you will get similar information like something , when you remember something that lies in the past .
And I'm sure you know these stories one tells in a convivial round , of the old days .
Back then , hey , that and that happened , and that was so nice , and the further the stories date back , the more beautiful the stories are likely to get , hey , at that time people were much more drunk , the evening was much more convivial then , sunsets was much more romantic then , the waterfall was much higher then .
And , I'm asking you , if we do that in retrospect , meaning if we really change our memories , why don't we do it actively ?
I have when I came here , my uncle showed me a picture of his cabin in Switzerland .
A very nice picture , and it's a very nice cabin .
But the picture is even a little nicer than the cabin , so it's artistic freedom , he explained to me , the cabin is turned there a little , there is a little more grass in front of it , there is a beautiful dog lying in front of it , the sun is shining onto the Alps there , it is a picture of that cabin , indeed , that cannot be denied .
And why don't we do that with our own thoughts then , our own memories , hey , why should it bother me if I make what I'm thinking about there even more beautiful ?
Indeed you have artistic freedom in your own thoughts .
Perhaps you know some people , who , when you see them in the morning , just have such gray eyes , what's wrong ?
Well , I didn't sleep well , there was something going through my head all night .
Really , all night , and I didn't get this thought out of my head .
I think it's the other way round , it was he who didn't let go of the thought .
The son of a friend of mine was a little depressed when he came to Germany , because his mother stayed in Hongkong and he just terribly missed her .
What the father did , well , he sat down with his son every night and said , or asked , so , what was the nicest thing that happened today ?
What was the nicest thing , tell me , and then he made him tell , made him embellish it , made him detail the nice thing that happened today .
And within two weeks the son felt great .
And then it was okay , that mommy was gone , she will come to visit after all .
He did that with him throughout his whole youth , and today he's one of the most positive people I know .
So it's not the memories that influence the way we are , but it is our focus on them , our focus on which thoughts we use .
And how much energy we waste or use on that .
So if some evening you get stuck with a thought or say , today that was , that's so , no , I really don't need that , then why not do it like , maybe you know this , Tom Cruise in that science fiction movie , where he has this holographic computer he takes his data from and works on it , why don't you do that , too , pick out your picture that you just have of this , well , not so great , actually you say , yeah , okay , that happened today , but zap , get rid of it .
What else do we have today , ah , something nice , well , look there , oh , I really liked that today , man , that was nice , right ?
And take that with you then .
Integrate that in your unconscious and have it contribute in the background .
Or if someone in authority is mean to you , you know , be it your boss , or your wife , or your husband , sorry , try and laugh about it .
In this case , too , take the picture , and put a funny hat on that person's head .
One of those fools caps with pompoms , have horses jump around in the background , yes , you laugh , why do you laugh ?
Because you are picturing it right now , because thoughts like that are funny .
And suddenly you can deal with the situation much better .
So , is it possible to erase memories ?
No , I believe our brain has so much capacity that it can memorize everything .
That's no problem , however , because we are free to choose how much emphasis we put on or how much importance we attach to an event , a memory , a thought , that depends on us .
And my appeal to you , play with the pictures in your head , use the power of your unconscious and give it suggestions every day that enrich your life .
Well , good afternoon .
Thank you very much for the invitation .
When someone asks me at a party what I do in in my free time , and I tell them that , together with friends , I organize a music festival , then I see sparkling eyes and in the heads of my listeners the association of dancing crowds of people , portable toilets , tent cities and mud fighting appear .
When I then continue that the festival I am speaking of is a festival for classical music , the pictures of the dancing crowds of people disappear , making room for pictures of old people that are seated in straight , long seating rows in rooms with wood paneling and concentrate on the art .
Frank Zappa once said , talking about music is like dancing about architecture .
And this is almost the same with what we are doing .
However , to give you an impression about what I am going to talk about in a minute , I brought a short film .
Film
There is something rock'n'roll about it .
That is what it expresses it the best in my opinion .
Since two thousand and nine , the podium festival growths because the people enjoy doing something completely different .
We , as organizers , are today between eighteen and mid-twenties or at the end of twenty and have experienced very early in our childhood what incredible power and joy classical music can evoke .
But we have also experienced that the conventions of a cultural business and the market for classical music sometimes can , well , spoil the joy a bit .
And we are firmly convinced that the so-called crisis of the classical music is not a problem of the contents , this means of the music itself , but rather of its form of representation .
Hence , we wonder how to create a concert that gives back to the music the closeness , the joy and power that we love .
How can we organize a festival for classical music that goes beyond the conventions of the cultural business ?
We start by querying the parameters that you all know from classical concerts , such as space , time , light and context .
Let's take the example of the relationship between the audience and the musicians .
Normally , there is a gap between the stage and the audience .
We try to remove it .
Here you see a picture of our Jam concerts .
The musicians are among the audience , they drink beer , during pauses they speak with the audience , get up , play one , two tracks and sit down again among the audience .
The whole thing becomes more relaxed in the course of the evening .
Everyone who likes to participate goes onto the stage and comes back .
Or the sitting in the concert .
In a classical concert it is that you are seated on more or less comfortable , hard chairs , similar to them here , and look in front of you and listen .
However , there is music to which you cannot sit still .
And we thought about how to implement this .
When you sit differently and you can move to rhythmical music , then you listen differently .
Furthermore , we didn't have only one stage , but four , installed around the audience .
The audience could turn with the music .
Like that everyone had the possibility to sit one time during the evening in the first row .
It was important for us that we do not organize no matter what event , but that we consider the music as the most important .
That we ask ourselves which spaces and atmosphere around , but also in the heads of the people , music needs in order to have the effect it should have ?
Like that concerts arise in the middle of the night at ten pm in churches that are actually only illuminated by candles , in clubs , on industrial wasteland , in old wine cellars .
However , it is not only the rooms around and the lightening that can make music vivid and recent but also the combination with other types of art .
And like that we are very happy that , for some years now , we are working together with the national youth ballet who helps us to create dances or movements to chamber music which was not written to dance to .
Like that choreographies to string quartets of Beethoven or to chamber music of Steve Reich develop .
And this year , we fulfilled a childhood dream , if you want to call it like that .
For the first time , we realized a concert together with a team of an animated film .
We managed to create an artistic synthesis of the soldier's tale by Igor Strawinsky with actors , dancers , live music and an animated film .
This worked especially well as we had a big community on the Internet that supported us to create this play .
A crowd funding campaign helped us to collect a lot of money from people everywhere in Germany in order to realize this .
Anyway , this festival is something that is developed by a community .
We are very happy that we found a home in the small town of Esslingen next to Stuttgart .
The town has the perfect size , it is big enough to find great rooms and interesting places for concerts , but also small enough to attract attention .
When at the beginning of the year , during springtime , forty great musicians from everywhere in Europe come to town , the people will remark that there are more people with instrument cases in the streets than normally .
The whole festival is organized by volunteers .
We are a mixture of pupils , students , doctors , literary scholars , music and media technicians , so totally mixed .
And around a leading team of three people that keeps an eye on the overall organization or coordination and the financing , seven to ten active people who commit for one year to undertake functions , form the core team .
Admittedly, also voluntarily , but they take care for one year that there is someone who sees , for instance , for the ticketing or the assistance of the artists and the event technology and that everything is organized until the festival begins .
We are all working in our free time and we live everywhere in Germany .
This means that most of the work is done in a decentralized way and on an Internet platform .
We only meet three times a year for a long weekend , we brainstorm , discuss the one or the other problem that appeared and we also take care of our interpersonal relationships which is extremely important when something like this should work .
At the festival itself , there are twenty to thirty additional volunteers that bring along their hands for some days or weeks and help where help is needed , when carrying chairs , when decorating rooms , when selling tickets , when coating sandwiches .
And of course , the musicians are there for these fifteen days .
You'd almost think that now there is everything that is needed for a festival like that .
But we go farther .
Because we have built a big community around us in Esslingen that supports us in what we we want to do .
This starts with classical sponsoring and goes over to practical things like , for instance , catering , there we have a baker who delivers bread to us or a organic food store that provides fresh groceries .
The whole year round , the ticketing is done and the tickets are sold by a book store in town .
Up to possibilities for practice .
We found a great deal of private individuals in Esslingen who leave us their living rooms in order that the musicians may practice there .
And like that the festival became something special in this town and of the people in this town .
They identify in a special way with the festival .
Since the beginning of the year and due to the great help of the local citizens , we were able to bring into being a citizens' foundation that serves as a structure and a safeguard for the whole undertaking and its future .
We as the workforce of Podium believe that classical music rocks , provided that it is placed into the right hands .
Therefore , we are extremely happy that young musicians in whole Europe take the lead and organize Podium festivals at their home towns .
Well , if you still cannot really imagine how it feels to experience classical music in that way , just come by .
At the beginning of the next year , we will be in Esslingen and we would be happy to see you there .
Yes, ladies and gentlemen , learning .
You might think that means acquiring knowledge .
Knowledge is a part of learning or a consequence of learning , but I think learning is so much more , for example gathering experience and gaining power of judgment .
Knowledge times experience times power of judgment , a nice formula for shaping one's life .
What I've learned from art and culture , well , there is so much to tell , given that in the meantime , I've been working in that field .
And that's why I thought it might be good to add another aspect to this rather ambiguous title which shall run through my presentation .
Art is beautiful , yet it requires a lot of work .
You had to laugh , too .
Somebody always laughs , though most people know this saying .
Why do people laugh ?
I think this is down to the fact that the word beautiful contains something that we are not able to understand .
We sometimes say that art is fascinating .
We wouldn't actually refer to work as being fascinating .
Sometimes even .
People who like to work are fascinating for me .
But when it comes to work , we would rather think of daily life whereas art is an area beyond daily life in which we plunge into , gather experience , develop our own thoughts .
And now I'd like to present to you my personal path , in three hours I divided this presentation up into five chapters , each chapter title starting with the letter I , so that it's totally simple for you .
It starts with Invention which stands for childhood , it goes on with Inspiration which stands for my youth , I won't tell you everything , don't worry , it goes on with Initiation , later I'll tell you why I chose this word for the start of my professional career .
Next is Interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , the fifth chapter will be Identification .
Some of you might know these pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach .
Inventions , for two and three voices .
You learn those in the first two , three years , assuming you practice reasonably , which I did .
And at the age of ten , eleven years , I played these minor pieces on the piano , not far from here at the Kreuzeskirche , at home .
These pieces are characterized by their counterpoint .
While a melody is playing , there is a corresponding voice , yet it is totally different .
Rhythm is the same , yet the two voices contrast each other .
And this , ladies and gentlemen, is a crucial aspect of art , to be able to combine opposing elements even if it's just two voices , to think coherently , whether it's the present , the future , sometimes the past , in works of art , pictures , choreographies , theater plays , combining things that take place at different points in time , this is what art is about .
And I've learned to play two melodies at the same time , sometimes even three , with the inventions for three voices , to hear each melody , to emphasize one of them and not the other .
Amongst other things , this is what I've learned .
I've never forgotten another incident and I was a bit worried that maybe today , the same would happen again .
I played a piano concert , there were more people in the audience than here today and right in the middle of a Beethoven sonata , I struggled .
I had forgotten the notes .
I played it by heart .
So I started again and at the same point , I still didn't know how to go on .
The audience was sweating almost more than I was because unhurriedly , I went back to my seat , grabbed my notes , laid them down and started again for the third time .
You wouldn't believe the thundering applause I received afterwards .
Still, that was a tough experience .
Maybe it was one of the experiences helping me to realize that , though I quickly got a student card afterwards , maybe I shouldn't become a professional piano player , for it's easier to cheat as a speaker .
Yes , the next chapter of my youth is entitled Inspiration and I'd like to tell you some stories about that , too .
When I was sixteen , I went to my piano teacher and I told him , dear Mr Jure , I'd like to play a waltz by Chopin .
And he said , Oliver , that's not possible .
You would have to had visited a lot of coffee houses and gained considerable experience with the ladies .
Now imagine that , telling that a boy at the tender age of sixteen .
Of course , I've not forgotten it .
From this point , I practiced even more .
By the way , meanwhile I've been to a coffee house a couple of times .
I practiced and I recall one situation that , since then , I've never again experienced .
It was the Scherzo in B minor by Chopin and now I turn to the aspect of work , there was one part I simply didn't master and it was one of the most beautiful parts , you really had to spread your arms , go back to your normal position and spread your arms again .
Unfortunately , I cannot play it now , there is no piano here and I wouldn't be able to anymore .
I played this part twenty , thirty times consecutively and suddenly , I got it .
And then I continued to play and play and play , I went into ecstasies , the only thing I recall is that suddenly , I threw myself on the floor and laughed .
I was delirious .
I hadn't drunk , I hadn't taken drugs , the music had driven me to that point .
Through this experience , I learned to actually accept emotions .
And sometimes , it's the right thing to do , to work so that you fall into such a trance, into this condition which I'd like to call flow .
When everything runs by itself .
We actually had this situation in an organization at the capital of culture in two thousand and ten .
And there , everything went almost by itself , when we were organizing the final event , it took us only two and a half months while usually it would take you one and a half years .
Well , so much for my piano stories , yes , for my artistic work .
Now I'd like to turn to my studies , to Initiation .
At first , I was a musician , yet this was merely a hobby .
We played as a quartet , pipe quartet , piano quartet .
I gave piano lessons and in this way , I was still able to keep up my enthusiasm for music and enjoy being part of a community besides my law studies .
Singing in the choir , breathing together , singing a mass in H minor , wonderful events which were an enriching experience for me .
Then I arrived at a point where I got to the Grillo theater in Essen as a law student , in dramaturgy and administration , and I entitled this chapter Initiation because this idea , this thought came to my mind , to make a profession out of that combination art , culture , politics and law , at that time , in nineteen eighty , I had just become a member of the Social Democratic Party anyhow .
I wanted to succeed in enabling culture , to make it my leitmotif .
Thus , I wanted to commit myself to art , not as an artist , otherwise you wouldn't say art worker , but to continue and make progress as a cultural worker .
I was at the theater and I made inquiries , in Germany , cultural management studies did not exist yet , only in Vienna , so I went there and from then on , I increasingly dealt with that one question , what could you do to enable art , to improve conditions for art , to lay the foundations for good management , good administration ?
And that was the reason I advanced in my professional life , towards this profession , and so I assumed a leading position in cultural affairs at the age of thirty five .
Still , my professional life started off differently , I entitled this chapter Interaction .
In nineteen eighty six , I got to the Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag .
The Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag has its office in Cologne .
I'm from the Ruhr Area , though sometimes in my CV it says , Oliver Scheytt from Cologne , because I was born in Cologne , this upsets me , I need to change that .
Still , I have Rhineland roots because my grandparents on my mother's side were originally from Cologne and in Cologne , I celebrated carnival .
I hadn't enjoyed it that much before and suddenly , I was drawn into a different type of culture , a popular culture , a culture that was lived by people in this bureaucratic structure of the Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag .
As soon as carnival approached , we found ourselves in a totally different situation , in totally different conditions .
And with my colleague and friend Jochen Dieckmann , who would later become the Minister of Finance and Justice in North Rhine-Westphalia , I played music at the Cologne night , he played the guitar , I played the piano , a third played the bass , at that time , I could play the famous carnival song Alles-hat-ein-Ende-und-nur-die-Wurst-hat-zwei by heart , amongst others .
We played songs from the Wildecker Herzbuben , well , of course we adapted the lyrics to match the Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag , we practiced for months .
And it was actually the people who embodied carnival .
It was my fate that on the ninth of November nineteen eighty nine , I was studying for my doctoral examination and didn't notice the fall of the Berlin wall .
I woke up the next day , I had my oral exam , oh, the wall is down , right .
In a hurry , I prepared myself to answer any questions concerning the Basic Law .
And from then on , I was the representative of cities in the GDR .
And again , I saw interactions taking place between two German cultures .
In fact , we speak the same language , music is played equally wonderfully there , now and in the past , but a lot of things were revalued , reinterpreted .
Different from carnival , this was largely initiated by the state and not just the people , and I perceived it as a source of great enrichment to experience how German identity slowly forced its way and how the German unification treaty brought together these two states , I will come back to that later .
Since then , Germany has been called a cultural state .
Since then , culture has increasingly been promoted on a federal level , too .
But it was in the city of Essen that I learned and experienced interaction first and foremost .
From the beginning on , we had the cultural by the way , I had a business card at that time , imagine that , when I started to work here in nineteen ninety three , on my business card it said Head of the Culture and Leisure Department .
I still have it .
Leisure stood for the Grugapark , it shouldn't say Head of the Culture and Grugapark Department .
Actually , I was the first head of Grugapark .
Leisure is something I haven't right , in any case it was wonderful to have this business card , though it was gone rather soon , because then I got in charge of education and therefore was able to establish and shape connections to the education sector .
We did a lot for urban development , just have a look at what we created between the Lichtburg cinema , the adult education center and the minster , have a walk along the cultural trail where you can experience interactions between works of art and architecture , from the minster to the Folkwang Museum along the blue stones .
We , and I , were able to shape numerous interactions and I experienced and realized what it means when different people from different areas together pursue one goal .
You might have noticed , I'm getting away from art more and more , rather turning to culture , which defines us , which focuses on the binding element between people , between cultures , between communities , to put it in another way , but I will come back to art later .
On the tenth of January two thousand and one , interaction between the cities of the Ruhr Area also became an issue of interest when we , seven department heads , had the idea that the Ruhr Area could apply for European Capital of Culture .
But nevertheless , this last chapter , this fifth chapter is entitled Identification .
This word has two meanings , first, I identify with something , thus , I am committed to something , second , I can also use it as a verb and say , I identify something , meaning that I recognize something .
And always with its distinct features .
I recognize something with its features , that's why I say , I identify you or him or this community .
And I identify with something if I am committed to it and say , this belongs to me , I want to identify with this .
And that was a really huge action .
Trying to mobilize five point three million people , fifty three cities , to identify in both senses , to be committed and to realize that we are a community within Europe .
A huge , as we then called it , metropolis , at least a community of many people living in a huge conurbation and speaking a common language , though from one hundred and forty nations , and our main task was to initiate identification among the people and also to learn from them , of course .
At SchachtZeichen , at the motorway closure , at many other events .
There was one experience in the context of the European Capital of Culture only a few people were aware of .
Two schools , Nizhny Novgorod and Essen , worked together , young pupils from the girls' grammar school in Borbeck as well as young pupils from a German school in Nizhny Novgorod rewrote letters of young men from Stalingrad into a theater play , final letters dealing with home , farewell , love , death .
And it was a special moment indeed , young girls quoting letters of young men and then young Russians quoting letters of young men from Germany in slightly broken German .
And suddenly , one of these young men sat down at the piano and played this Chopin waltz which I absolutely adored .
Oh , and then he quoted from a letter and said , I'm a pianist , it was a letter home , he played a young German in the play , and never again I will be able to play a Chopin waltz again for I just lost two fingers due to frostbite .
And he wrapped his fingers with a gauze bandage , sat down at the piano again during this theater play at the Zeche Carl and tried to play the Chopin waltz .
And he failed .
It was such a moving scene , I stepped forward and asked , what have we learned today ?
In the Capital of Culture we've learnt that together , many people can achieve a lot , but first and foremost we've learnt that in Central Europe , we've been living in peace for sixty years now and that culture is the binding element preventing us from fighting each other merely because of the fact that we speak different languages , that we identify with each other , that we belong somewhere .
And that was a wonderful experience for me and you will notice that learning is not just about knowledge .
Learning is always about gaining experience and power of judgment .
And if we are creative and accept creativity , inventions , if we take our inspiration from art and culture to take our own stand , in communicating with art , if we interact and ultimately work continuously on our own identity by dealing with art and culture , then all of us will profit .
And I hope that you will have numerous artistic and cultural experiences from which you can benefit .
Thank you .
Well , thank you very much .
I suggest we just wait for the first picture .
So I have put some slides here to support my memory .
However , these are no scientific slides , but in my talk I rather want to find a direction and deal with a subject which I think is going to be a matter of great concern to us in the years to come .
After the introduction I finally know now , thank you very much for that , what TED actually means , and I think this talk can indeed be classified in the field of education .
And then I had also heard that the talk should be given in English if possible , but wenn you look at this you see that you would not understand what I wanted to say in English , I would not know immediately how to say it and this is why I have left the talk in German after all .
How we are going to die .
Regarding this , I need to tell you about Rosalinde first .
Rosalinde was a patient in the hospital where I am in charge of the radiology department , and she had fallen .
She was over ninety years old and always loved dancing into May because it also made her remember her husband , her first husband , who had died in the war .
And so she went to dance every year on the first of May and danced until late and probably drank a glass of punch too much once and ended up falling and broke , you can see it here on the right side , her leg , her femoral neck .
She had already fallen once a couple of years before and had broken her left leg in the same way at the same occasion .
And at that time I was already working there as a doctor and saw how she spent weeks in the intensive care unit , how she was treated with antibiotics , also how she was resuscitated , and I overheard the discussion in which was said , does this even make sense after all ?
Does it even make sense to use such intensive methods to treat a person that old ?
That is to resuscitate , to give artificial respiration , in the intensive care unit for weeks , can you even expose somebody to that ?
And she was healed then .
Five years later I come into the clinic , see the name Rosalinde , and I can easily remember it because it is just so rare , even at that time , and she had , when she had been dancing into May , broken her other leg .
This raises the question , what is it actually that I discuss when I talk about how a person has to decide for himself what he writes in his living will or which health care proxies he signs ?
And this is more or less what the talk is about .
Here you see the forefather of the name , how we are going to die .
It is a nineteen-ninety-seven book , how we are going to work , a report to the Club-of-Rome .
And at that time glottalization was advancing in such a strong way that you asked yourself , what can interconnected work look like ?
So they said , and you can still look that up in the book today , there will be a quality control , so that the parts always fit together .
There will be an interconnection of work processes , there will also be much more outsourcing , to China for example , that was a major topic at that time .
And this is how it turned out then , that basically the work of the individual , that is assembling something , manufacturing something , was becoming worth less and less , that there was more and more control also of the quality he delivers , of the accuracy .
And that , in my estimation , people were less and less confident of their work and became more and more part of a little wheelwork , which was all about achieving the highest value creation possible , and not about also defining yourself by your work anymore .
And now if we apply this to the nursing care and medical sector , then , of course , there is a similar development .
When you hear on TV what doctors , nurses , and also geriatric nurses complain about most , it 's the so called documentation requirements .
And this means they have to document what they have done so that it is enforceable , so that it gets even paid at all , and if it isn't documented , the Medical Service might say , we will not pay this care or this medical treatment .
But because of this documentation the work of the nurses increasingly loses its value and the thought of fulfilling one's task and contributing it with commitment out of personal conviction is being neglected while they are being controlled , punished , and not considered credible .
A good friend of mine has gone to Holland now , because he had enough of how things were done here , he had a general medical practice , gave it up and went to Holland to become a geriatric physician .
More often than not , the Dutch are a step ahead when it comes to developments like this and what he , Martin , had experienced was that more and more old people commute between nursing home , hospital , back and forth , because the nursing home didn't know what to do anymore when a person's health declined .
They are hospitalized then , have their health restored , go back to the retirement home or nursing home and are further looked after .
And so this general practitioner had thought , if in Holland there is something organized like this , then I would like to be trained there in order to promote some change here , so that there is a chance to escape from this vicious cycle of lacking credibility and undignified treatment of human beings .
Now , having arrived there in Holland , after it had taken him a lot of effort to learn the language , he had to discover that what is happening there is exactly what happened in this how-we-are-going-to-work .
Dying , too , is more and more subject to an introduction of quality control .
Credibility is no longer what counts , but at one point in an injunction you determine , for example , I don't want to be resuscitated or I don't want to be hospitalized when I am in a nursing home .
And this is respected then .
In the Netherlands it goes like this , on the third day , a conversation is held with the newly arrived residents , and then they have to decide , do I want to be hospitalized or do I not want to be hospitalized anymore , if something happens to me .
It's the same with , I want to be resuscitated or I don't want to be resuscitated .
This data is sent to the central administration and that's where this geriatric physician is , who always has the medical records before him and decides on this basis .
Now if we think back to Rosalinde , who as I said liked dancing into May and had fallen once , and we imagine that at some point she had written a living will stating , I don't want to be resuscitated , then this second dancing into May , where , admittedly , she fell a second time , she would not have lived to see .
And now my friend , who is over there in Holland , is worrying about how to deal with this .
In fact , today , about sixty to seventy per cent of people do not die at home anymore , but in hospitals , nursing facilities , and on top of that , these nursing facilities are , you can see it that way , not the ideal living space for elderly people after all , but there is often a financially narrow leeway , the nursing staff is often over-strained and the promotion in itself of being alive happens , in my opinion , only to a limited extend .
Certainly , there are homes in which this is done very well , there are very enthusiastic people who get involved there , but when I look at the overall balance , and we have twelve thousand patients per year , so about five , six thousand perhaps , who are perhaps admitted to us from the nursing homes , then I personally would say , it is indeed difficult to get along there and keep up your inner self-confidence .
Of course , this whole issue has pecuniary reasons , that's for sure , this whole quality control , this control has been established because after all there is not enough money for all people to be taken care of in the best possible way and in full scope , and for the people who provide the care or the medical treatments to be payed in such a way that they can say , I'm doing fine with this , I as a nurse can , for example , feed a family with one or two children .
This simply isn't today's reality , but you need two incomes in the nursing and geriatric sector and in most cases even this is just enough .
This introduction of quality control as a consequence of a steadily growing market one wants to regulate also has an impact for the concerned individuals .
And now I come to how one might be able to evade this , so what do we do after all , because I have started by asked questions and have shown that the situation is not all that easy for the persons concerned .
And in this respect I have simply dusted off the German basic law and picked out article one , because I think a society always needs structures like this , legal structures also , which serve as a foundation for the whole thing , for what happens in our society .
And after all in the basic law article one it says , human dignity shall be inviolable .
And the second sentence there says , to protect it shall be the duty of all state authority .
And what I sometimes miss is yet a third sentence saying that each individual person for himself should also have the mission to protect and defend his dignity .
Because this is a way to free yourself from this trap where you say I pass this on to others and they shall somehow look after me and take care of me so that at least I don't have to think much about how I am going to die one day .
Because after all that's how it is , although we don't like to face this matter , one day we will arrive at that point .
Hopefully not until late , at the age of hundred or a hundred and ten .
Of course , it is according to my job to say , I wish this for everyone and that's also what I want to provide for , but at some point one will have to face this subject , and then when this happens or simply , when you are seventy-five , eighty-five , or ninety-five , it can be late in life already , to say , I want to think about this question now .
When the time has come to think about it , what does my dignity consist of , then in the end you will think of aspects which reveal , what were the five most important things for me in my life after all ?
There is a book now that is quite in vogue .
It is self-respect , of course , then it is the friends I have , with whom I can discuss and exchange experiences , who know me and who accompany me through life , it is the family members .
It surely is the confidence between people , with which I might also be involved , in the geriatric sector or in the medical sector or a priest or a lawyer or another person with whom I enter into a relationship .
And of course there are many individual factors which play a role , I won't go through all of them now .
But when you start to consider these three points , then you have a number of tasks already , how you may have to orient yourself in life to protect your own dignity in the end .
And then there is another factor , that we experience a certain dictatorship of the do-gooders , I have taken this here as a text or as an example for that .
Other people cannot make these necessary decisions or comply with the behavior that is going to be required .
That is my firm conviction .
Our dignity can only come from within ourselves .
So the question is not , what will others do for me , who will take care of me , nurse me , or who will speak up for me , who will approach me ?
But it is exactly the other way round , to ask , where can I reach out to people , where can I get involved and gain dignity , so that I can deal with these questions and take a stand and adjust myself .
And then when it says , how we are going to work , so this quality control that has been imposed to us from outside , then one possibility to escape from this mechanism is to say , I define myself by my inner dignity .
Because nobody can tell me how I want to see myself and which position I want to adopt .
And I don't have to conform with general moods and opinions , which say , you have to fill in a living will now and since you are that old already , consider carefully whether you want to be resuscitated or whether you want to be taken to the intensive care unit .
After all , these are questions I can only , probably , treat conclusively after long preparatory work .
This human dignity is an inner posture that lies inside of me and that cannot be transmitted from outside , that cannot be protected by the state , nor by law , and that other people , too , can allow to me and might be more likely to allow to me , when I have dealt with them myself before , so that they know what kind of person I am .
And such conversations need spaces and regarding this I think , and this is how I thought of the title for this talk , and prepared here , such spaces like the Kreuzeskirchenviertel in Essen , I have tried to acquaint you with both on an image , spaces , where we need to think about subjects like this , where there is a protected space , so that it is not offending , that maybe it is not too theoretical , but that above all an exchange takes place there .
So that , when we are old , we are in the position to say , wow , a dance into May , despite my possibly very old age , that would be nice again .
Thank you very much for your attention .
A very nice evening .
I brought two things .
If the first part is too boring for you , try to stay awake .
There will be a second one .
Let's start with the infinite .
That's nonsense , right , it might take some time .
What do you think ?
Do different infinities exist ?
Or is one infinity simply enough ?
Yes !
It's not that good having somebody here who understands this matter !
Well , in fact , but I'm going to keep it short , for those who know the issue .
This is quite the opposite of what we're doing .
We're dealing with just one infinity .
And I'd like to see that in contrast to finitude .
We know finitude , we imagine to know infinity .
And for the maths freaks , it's all about the order of quantities .
We're dealing with finitude and counting two object quantities , let's say , the first one is chairs , the second one is people .
Let's say , when looking into the box , we already know that it's a small number , three chairs and three people .
How can we check whether each quantity contains the same number of elements ?
If we counted , how would we do that ?
That means , at first we would count people, one , two , three , we have got three , we would count chairs , we see three chairs , one , two , three , that's it , wonderful .
You think so ?
Very good .
In finitude , this works perfectly , even with greater numbers, though it's annoying .
But it works .
Are there other ways to count ?
Are there other ways to check whether we have as many people as chairs ?
I've deliberately chosen chairs and people and nothing else .
Let them sit on the chairs .
This is called coupling !
You alright , that's obvious , isn't it , as soon as we're dealing with daily life situations , everyone understands !
Right , this is nice .
Well , the professional term would be coupling function and this is exactly how it works , right ?
You take somebody , put him on a chair , that's it .
The next couple , done , the next couple , everything fits perfectly , different people get different chairs , no chair remains empty and quantities are equal , okay ?
Now , let's move over to the infinite .
How can we compare two infinite quantities with each other ?
We would say , one quantity is that large or larger or smaller than the other one .
What can we do ?
Again, we would start to .
Exactly , that's wrong because the point is , if you started counting an infinitely large quantity , yes , I'd simply say , you wouldn't get to the other one .
Infinite , right , it's obvious , right ?
So , how does it work ?
Madam ?
No , Madam !
She had just started off correctly !
Coupling !
Well , let's have a look at that now .
Making a guess is rather inappropriate in the infinite , right ?
You don't see an end , right ?
The point is , there is a simple approach .
Let's say , I were using the number line , natural numbers , no , we as computer specialists need zero at the start , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
And let's say , we had a copy of this line and took away the infinite number of odd numbers from the copy .
The even numbers would remain , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , right ?
Okay ?
All even numbers are on the infinite line of natural numbers , but on the one line , the odd numbers are missing , on the other line , both even and odd numbers are included , okay ?
Let's call the quantity of even numbers G , the quantity of natural numbers N .
What do you think ?
Is G mightier , is it larger than N , the same or smaller ?
The same ?
That's quite audacious , yes , for the odd numbers are missing in that quantity .
Would anyone else like to make a guess ?
Smaller ?
Who says larger ?
Ah , she actually has no idea , right ?
This can't be true either , right ?
It can't be larger when something is missing , that doesn't work , right ?
Okay , you say smaller ?
One would think so , right ?
That's the common thing , what you would expect is of course wrong .
And now I'm going to explain you , why the quantities are equal .
How does it work ?
Exactly .
Yes , we couple .
That's the point .
We couple .
We take zero from the even quantity , we take zero from the natural quantity , we couple , we exclude .
The next after zero , after plus two comes two , after zero comes one , and I have a couple again .
Four , two , six , three , eight , four , okay ?
You can also reverse this , then it will be doubled , that's obvious , isn't it ?
It's crystal clear that this is possible through coupling , in the lecture , I always demonstrate this using an exercise band .
On this one right here , only the even numbers are included , still the band is equally large , right ?
We reduce the natural numbers to the even ones , the odd numbers are gone and the band is still equally large .
Only in the infinite , this is possible .
So , if you tell anybody about what we've learned today , we've learned about the infinite , yes , what does infinite mean , I only know finite ?
An infinite quantity has one quality which does not exist in finitude and this is an absolute characteristic , a genuine subset which is equally large .
This is not possible in finitude , if you send home two people out of three , only one will remain and beforehand , there were three .
Yes , with that , we have achieved the infinite .
Did anybody fall asleep ?
Alright .
Let's have a second part then , probability .
The professionals , conditional probability .
I brought you something .
I'm sure that at least one third of you will know this experiment and woe to those of them who participate nevertheless , right ?
So , let's call these doors A , B , C .
I've hidden something behind one of them , I hope you haven't noticed .
And you should first make a guess .
Where do you think have I hidden something , behind A , B or C ?
Make a guess , right here , our guessing expert .
You think it is C .
Any other ideas ?
A ?
Does anybody else have an idea ?
Well done , no , B was missing , right , otherwise , he will never stop , right ?
That's right .
It really doesn't matter , you mustn't think all three letters will be mentioned and I will choose one .
It doesn't matter , right ?
This is crystal clear , for the probability that you're lucky in the end is just one third .
There are three doors , it really doesn't matter , right ?
Now I'll be doing the following , I will simply open one .
Fair enough , of course I know where it is .
Woe betide anyone who , right .
So , I know where it lies and the guessing or estimating or however you want to call it goes into a second round .
So , I'm going to explain the rules just now on the fly .
It goes as follows , we're going into a second round .
Now , assuming I choose A , right ?
Right, now I'll have to show you a door behind which nothing is hidden and which you didn't guess .
Because if you say B now , I know that it is not hidden behind B .
Then there would be no second round .
I'd say , nyah nyah nyah , just my luck , end of game .
But I have to go into the second round , for these are the rules .
Thus , I can only open a door behind which both nothing is hidden and which you didn't guess .
Now one question remains , and this is the conditional probability , given that B is open and there is nothing behind it , you've got one last chance to make a new guess .
You can now stick to A, then I will conclusively open A .
I will open the door you will choose .
Or you say , I'm going to open C .
Now the maths question is , has the probability increased having this knowledge at hand ?
Puh , very good , B is open , now I know it is behind C .
Or , thank God that B has been opened , I always wanted to stick to A , that's it .
Or would you say , now it's fifty-fifty after all , no , forget it , there are only two doors remaining , now it doesn't matter whether you switch or stay .
What do you think ?
It does matter .
Fifty-fifty .
Why does it matter ?
Very good .
Why is it fifty-fifty ?
Yes , exactly , that's wrong .
It sort of seems as though we had practiced that yesterday , right ?
But that's them , right , a new no , just kidding .
Alright , here is how it goes , it's quite simple , yes .
Everyone understands this from the age of six to , I don't know , well , I mustn't say sixty , otherwise I won't be part of this rather soon , right ?
So , actually everyone understands this .
There is a probability of one third that it lies behind this door .
And the probability that it lies behind one door is always just one third .
You can make any guess you want , there is always a two thirds probability that you are wrong .
That means , if you would have had two guesses , right , in roulette you can do this , you can gamble on two dozens , right , if you left out zero , all this is possible in real life .
But here , we only have one door .
Right , here is how it goes , it's not two thirds that you guess .
So the two thirds lie here , but they can only be behind one door after all !
It's not behind this door !
So , what's more likely then ?
No , I've actually hidden it somewhere !
So , what's more likely now ?
Is it better to stay or to switch ?
Now it's easy , right ?
Yes , of course !
Well , that wasn't too difficult , right ?
Ha !
What do we learn from this ?
You were unlucky .
Why ?
It's simple , even two thirds are not one hundred percent : this is the difference between theory and practice .
I hope all of you could profit from this lecture .
Thank you very much .
Mr Reichert , it is completely depressing that you announce me right after Jamie Oliver who had just finished talking about unhealthy diet , bad food and overweight people .
But I'll try my best to wash away these impressions .
Because I grew up on a Demeter farm and until I was twelve years old, I didn't know McDonald's .
What an introduction , exactly .
Well .
Thank you very much for today's invitation .
I grew up not far away from here .
And I'm not sure whether this was the reason Mr Reichert came up with the idea to ask me if I wanted to participate in TED at the lake and talk about a certain topic .
Today , I chose : the topic trust .
Motivation is clearly a decent topic , too , and I can only agree with Mrs Reichert who said that maybe after that , one or the other will do more sport .
I'd be in for that .
Well , given that it's raining this evening , going jogging might be a little over-the-top , but I have to work out tomorrow because in three weeks , on the twenty second of June , at midsummer , I will be driving from Trondheim to Oslo by bike - that's four hundred and fifty kilometers .
Meaning that I'm not spared the training tomorrow just because of the rain .
So , if you want to join in cycling , it starts tomorrow morning in Abendtal , you're all welcome .
I already briefly mentioned that I'll be talking about trust today .
And on purpose , I started with the topic of basic trust .
No worries , the beautiful , slightly hackneyed , blind trust will be addressed later .
Earlier , on my journey to this place , I was briefly thinking about how I could best describe where I come from .
So , I come from a village with six houses , lots of apple trees , some hop poles and on my parents' farm we have apples , apple juice and hop , and what do you make of hop , beer .
In sport , trust of course doesn't mean doping to me but apple juice and beer .
Why am I telling the story of my origin ?
For me it's one of the most important stories that I actually grew up in the countryside , that I grew up in a village with two big brothers , the oldest being the one who sees .
The second being as blind as I am .
Meaning that he sees bright and dark , like me , he can recognize a window in a room , whether the light is turned on or not .
Which is quite useful for today's electricity bill .
He , or the two of us can see when something is right in front of us .
A post for example , but I always say that I cannot tell the difference between a post and a man .
So much for the topic of old men , right .
Always make connections .
To start with , for me one question has of course always been essential , that is , how do you come to trust somebody and how do you gain this great trust , the basic trust that we all need , in a rather special situation , I dare say .
And the situation was definitely special for my parents , given that , this might as well apply to you , they didn't know any blind people before my brother and me.
We were the first to rather suddenly turn up in their life out of the blue .
And then they somehow had to deal with this situation .
And I think it was more than fortunate that being farmers , my parents didn't have all day to stand next to us and take our hands to lead us or to say , there's a wall , just grope your way along the wall and then you can feel where you are going .
A, it would have been unpleasant - we have woodchip wallpaper at home .
And B , our parents encouraged us right from the start to always go where our seeing brother is .
Thus , to run around the house alone , to run the stairs up and down , to risk something .
At that time, my blind brother pushed me across the yard with a toy tractor and under a trailer .
Even today , I still have that scar .
Well , big brothers - not just good for the elbows but also for cosmetic flaws .
And our brothers , and my brothers and I , outside the farm building , we did whatever possible , especially cycling .
And enthusiastically , the seeing brother started to ride the bicycle at the age of three and , of course , we also wanted to do so , Michael and I .
And then we started to cycle with stabilizers , similar to many small children in the past , today things have become much easier wit the run bike .
Until the kids are able to ride a bike .
But we started off using stabilizers , after some time , we went without them .
And then , the huge question arises : how do you orient yourself ?
And how do you gain trust , one the one hand , the parents' trust that the children will at some point in time get off the bike instead of falling down and , on the other hand , our trust that we will not permanently crash into something .
And our solution was of course , A , to listen to what our parents had to say , where to find risky spots , thus , where to find a car , where to find a trailer , where to find maybe even unusual things , fair enough , one cannot simply move houses , we knew where those were .
We had to orient ourselves in between them , we had to remember them but we also had to listen .
I'm afraid you won't be able to try that in here because otherwise , it would be so noisy , you wouldn't benefit .
But tonight , when you turn off the light and want to orient yourself in your bedroom or in anyone else's bedroom .
You can try to orient yourself by simply making a clicking noise with your tongue and you will notice , this applies for both human beings and bats , that you will hear resistance .
Comparable to bats which fly by using this radar , you will also be able to hear a wall approaching , thus , resistance , for sound is reflected differently .
And that has always been very important to me with regard to trust , thus , also regarding trust in movement .
If possible , to have maximum protection as well as the confidence , I have the opportunity to somehow help myself .
And to orient myself without much difficulty and obviously , without many accidents , of course there have already been some .
Of which , unfortunately , I haven't got any pictures left , I totally regret this myself , this was one of our favorite sports when we were children .
Climbing the higher buildings on our farm .
Here I've written down : to a certain extent , self-confidence grows with diversity .
And I mean that literally , because as a person that dealt with trust on the scientific side particularly later on during my pedagogy studies and my coaching education , I never tripped the way I experienced it myself .
Perhaps I never perceived it that drastically .
Certainly , this also has to do with the fact that of course not everybody is able to experience it by experiments like I did .
Diversity is crucial when discovering our strengths , so that at some point we will know what we're good at , what our talents are and where our strengths can best be applied .
And again it was our brother who always took Michael and me onto the roofs of our house .
Then he would say : okay , this right here is a ridge .
Somewhere there , you can climb out of the window , at the hop drying machine for example .
And then Johannes went first , Michael after him and I was probably still playing the little girl , no no , I'm not sure .
But honestly : who likes to stay at the bottom ?
Well , I don't .
And neither the others , I'd say , for here we are , the generation of young women .
So ultimately , I went with them .
The consequence was that at some point , we were all sitting on the ridge and my father arrived in a tractor with a trailer and didn't even know what to say .
Because obviously trust disappears when others begin to doubt .
So if the father had said : for God's sake , help , help , help , then the danger that anybody of us would have got scared and would have got off the roof somehow , I don't know , in case of doubt , by falling , jumping , rolling down , would have been rather imminent .
But this never happened .
He always had to pull himself together , so that he would guide us down the roof or send Johannes on ahead who would then lead us back .
And I found it just wonderful for me that we had these opportunities .
But no worries , of course this is not a necessary precondition to be able to do competitive sport later in your life .
I found all the different sports that were always important in my life , well , interesting .
And in particular , all of these were extremely good because I could find out about : where are my limits , what might be my talents .
For instance , I would've never become a decent thrower .
I never had the upper body for that .
And I still don't like going to the gym .
I prefer to be outside in the rain .
Not at five degrees like today .
Or in the pouring rain , but I still prefer to be outside rather than inside .
But personally , I was always able to discover my strengths and rely on them by trying out different sports .
The first was judo , for example .
And that was quite nice for me because the coach of our judo club used to say : okay , we've got lots of seeing children , there should be some blind children , too .
It works just fine actually because you had to grab each other's judo suit anyway .
And then you feel what the other person is doing .
And I always found trust in that , though , obviously , the longer the competition went on , the more difficult it was for me because then , the other could maybe do something that I didn't notice .
So there was just one method , that is the trust in my own speed .
Grab the other one , put one foot on the groin , fall backwards yourself , throw the opponent over your head and then he lies down and the fight is over because you get the full score .
I won't try that here .
I considered to do it , but no .
I think this might be a little too risky now .
And there wouldn't be any volunteers , right ?
No .
Blast , I thought so .
Okay .
The next important sports for me in school were cross-country skiing and biathlon .
My parents have been Alpine skiers up to this day and they taught us Alpine skiing when we were children .
But when I went to school , one thing was always important to me : how can I exercise as much as possible even after school to burn off my surplus energy ?
So at school , one possibility was to do cross-country skiing .
Though I always thought : all this is kind of boring because cross-country skiing is for grandmas , I think .
I thought so back in the days , today that has changed .
Then at some point I said : well , I'll do the cross-country skiing course .
It was only then that I realized , gosh , again , this sport is so diverse because you need fitness , you need strength , a decent coordination and it's quite the team sport .
Ring ring - have you noticed the similarities to your own job ?
It's the same with cross-country skiing .
You'll only get faster , if you totally trust your own equipment .
If you trust your own performance capacity , thus , the strength you'll be able to transfer it to your skies at any condition , bad weather , soft snow , icy snow .
And in my case , if you also trust your team .
Because as a blind sportswoman , of course I am dependent on an assistant skier .
And never before have I experienced such a weird thing - I have to use this word - the previous speaker , there was only one , already did my exercise today .
But it doesn't matter , we will do it again anyway .
Or maybe I will spare you that .
I'll do another exercise with one of you later .
Because I always do one particular exercise when talking about blind trust , I want the audience to imagine what it's like to do cross-country skiing when you see nothing and go downhill at a speed of fifty kilometers per hour .
In cross-country skiing , it goes like this , you have two sticks in your hands .
So , obviously , no free hand , otherwise , I could simply bring my white stick and find the course myself .
That doesn't work .
Thus , I have to find another solution .
So I have my assistant skier who runs ahead of me .
And he explains the course with the voice .
So his explanations have to be accurate .
And this is also important for trusting .
Being accurate in communication, thus in the explanations .
The assistant skier always says hop , if the course runs straight ahead , he indicates left and right turns by saying : left , eleven o'clock , then I know it goes slightly left , so this refers to the upper part of the old-fashioned clock with hands .
If he says : left , ten o'clock , it goes a little sharper to the left , and if he says : right , ten o'clock .
Okay , did you all understand that ?
Of course , this is a problem because I have to ask again or he has to correct himself again , then I definitely know that something is wrong .
And this is the crucial thing for me , having the assistant skier running ahead of me , I have to throw myself upon his mercy , to put it in a negative way .
To put it in a positive way : he is my aid enabling me to be really fast and ideally , to be faster than the others starting in that same competition .
And I can only achieve that if I succeed in pulling myself off with both arms , in pushing me forward , in standing on one leg and now I actually have to close my eyes , ha , ha , or I can keep my eyes open , it makes no difference .
And then I have to ski like that and I have to stand on my other leg and I'm allowed to balance myself a little but actually , I have to stand as quietly as possible .
Even with high boots .
Yes , and this is most important for me when I do cross-country skiing , how do I manage to tell this guy , well , I say guy because I almost exclusively have men as assistant skiers , how do I manage to tell him : hey , I need accurate explanations because , obviously , he is the seeing person .
So he doesn't know what to tell me .
Consequently , I am the one to pave the way for communication .
And that's exactly as in any other working process .
If somebody doesn't know my needs , he will of course not be able to help me , so that it's my turn to say : alright , I need you to announce the next bend a little earlier .
Or , similar to cycling , I also need you to tell me how high the mountain is because when we go up the PfÃ¤nder mountain , at some point you inevitably start to think , we have to be at the top soon .
And then you push yourself again like a maniac and yet , you do not reach the top .
And therefore I occasionally need the pilot , as you'd say in cycling , at the front of the tandem , who tells me , unfortunately , we've only gone for twenty minutes until now , well , recently , we needed thirty six minutes , so sixteen minutes to go sounds much better.
Thus , it's important for me to have accurate , precise information .
I hear murmuring , anybody else also going up the PfÃ¤nder ?
Any more bids ?
Well , I used to be faster than that , but this was in September and now in April , May , so far I haven't been faster than thirty six minutes to be honest .
And with the recent weather conditions , it's really tough .
And for me , as I mentioned , these explanations will only be possible if I listen closely .
If the other person explains his surroundings accurately , thus , giving me the opportunity to perfectly measure my risks .
And this is one of the most important aspects leading me to the conclusion , trust is rather about training than the proverbial blind trust .
To be honest , I do not make much of blind trust as a blind person .
Because I already experienced that an assistant skier mixed up right and left in his explanations .
Which was rather unfortunate in that competition because off the track , there was an abyss going down three meters .
And I fell down three meters into the abyss .
So , as I mentioned , that was long ago , obviously an oversight .
I know that because the assistant skiers have to turn around , thus , they have to indicate directions in mirror image .
And it still happens a lot today that people tell me left , and then they say : no , the other left .
So it was actually right , unfortunately .
It doesn't make that much of a difference in daily life .
But obviously , in a stressful situation , you probably all know that from work or university , whatever , if things have to go quickly .
Precision is quite often a rather difficult challenge .
But for me , as I mentioned , blind trust particularly means being aware of the risks .
And as someone who doesn't see I have a huge advantage , to be honest , because in many ways I am aware of my risks .
Well , by now I know most of them in cross-country skiing .
Whether it's crashing into a tree , falling down a slope , deep snow , I know the risks but of course I also know , and this is the important thing , the positive aspects .
Which can be achieved if there is trust .
And if you've found somebody who is one hundred percent accurate in what he says , just how I need it .
And in particular , somebody who has the same goals .
Because with regard to trust , this is the next crucial aspect .
You have to have the same goal and you have to be clear about what it actually means to build trust .
Because one is often quick to use this term , it comes up easily .
I trust him or her or myself .
But the crucial point is , this means so much .
That you expose so much to establish trust .
Because we humans try to fill everything with a certain meaningfulness , we want to see the purpose behind it .
And most often , the purpose is to succeed in achieving a goal together .
That we succeed , in my case , for example , I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro some weeks ago .
And I knew exactly , I had to find someone who , in this case , I could trust to such an extent that I would be able to reach the top of the mountain .
And how do you manage to finally climb the top of the mountain successfully ?
Well , okay , of course I had the huge advantage not to be able to notice some things , for instance , if there was an abyss with a depth of hundred meters right next to me .
I didn't care about that .
This can actually be an advantage , for the fear of heights is not a problem anymore .
And I worked again and again to get a handle on the fear of heights , independent of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro I did things like bungee jumping or base flying in Berlin where you rappel from a hotel on a steel rope .
It's kind of scary standing up there and hearing the cars at the bottom , you do not have to see a lot to understand that when I fall , it's about to be painful .
And I always found such things interesting .
Obviously , to experience the rush of adrenalin but also to know , hey , I can do it , I can focus myself on that , pull myself together , and I can simply have a new experience , too .
And that's quite similar to the Mount Kilimanjaro experience because climbing a mountain goes as follows , each day you're walking for ten hours and at some point , it becomes just boring .
You're walking and walking , only surrounded by stones and less and less plants .
At first , you are accompanied by a ranger carrying along a rifle from before the First World War .
So if you see a buffalo somewhere , the ranger is probably the last one to shoot it .
This would be the only exciting thing .
We merely saw the buffaloes from a distance or even only the others saw them .
So I placed great trust in the ranger , despite the strange weapon he was carrying .
Because I thought : well , okay , as I just said , I would probably be better off running away than waiting for him to load his rifle .
But as I said , otherwise it was rather monotonous because there was not much happening around you .
It only gets really exciting when things become difficult .
Thus, when you reach higher altitudes and the air is thinner .
Or when you have an abyss right next to you , when there is only a narrow path and to your left and right , it goes down .
Then it got really exciting , and if , in addition to that , it was night and everyone is wearing a headlamp , the mountain guide sometimes used to say , now he'd rather prefer that I was secured with a rope so that he would actually have an eye and a grip on me .
Because I was the only one without a headlamp and sometimes , that was a bit too risky for him .
We established trust because I said : well , of course I can totally trust my companion , my friend who was with me , I know her and we properly discussed that beforehand .
But I need some sort of security so that I wouldn't have to concentrate permanently because , can you imagine if you're confronted with somebody on the mountain constantly saying , a stone on the left , right , one o'clock , left , eleven o'clock ?
At some point, you will go crazy , and not just you , everyone .
So in this case , trust meant for us to find a connection , so we tied a rope to her rucksack which I held in my hand and then I walked behind her along the dangling rope .
In the other hand , I had a walking stick so that I was able to feel the height of the steps .
And at some point , she just stepped firmly on a stone with her foot or she knocked against a stone with her walking stick so that I knew what was about to come and didn't have to concentrate permanently .
And this actually demonstrated how wonderful it is to , obviously , approach the top of the mountain sometime , that this goal is within arm's reach again , similar to the gold medals in cross-country skiing .
The other thing that I realized is that the trust I have in me is not just present when I pursue a goal like reaching the peak of a mountain .
It's also the others who build trust when they realize how it works .
So when we were climbing the mountain at night , me and my companion were mostly walking ahead of the seven other participants and they were relatively close behind us and after each break , someone else was behind us and I was already wondering , say , why are they staying why is everyone always so keen on walking right behind us ?
At night , you cannot even stare at the girls from behind .
Apparently , that was not the reason .
And at some point , I realized , ah okay , of course , their faith in their abilities ultimately had come to an end , too .
You're walking through the darkness of the night , you start at twelve o'clock , and at the beginning , there is no light .
That's really exhausting if you're overtired , the air gets thin , it's nothing but exhausting and , for the time being , far from being a pleasure .
And then at some point they said : wow , it was actually quite practical to walk behind you as my friend explained to me in detail what our surroundings looked like , we didn't stop talking , you know how it is with women .
We talked the whole night and so the rest of our group had a sort of confirmation , an encouragement as they knew , okay , now there's only one hour left , this is what she then told me .
Or I told her about something that was not at all related to our mountain trip .
And to know exactly that somebody is still there who might not feel good right now , too , we also talked about that , there's only one hour left , the sun is about to rise .
It's these things , even this mirror from outside which , once more , can enhance trust considerably and can contribute to the fact that thus you reach your personal gold medal .
And for me , trust is actually given and is given in its best possible way if at some point , the personal gold medal and what you really want to achieve is fully present in your imagination .
That's obvious , of course , with gold medals in sports which you bite into , I don't actually know why they do this , no idea , maybe to test the value or to check whether , in the end , there's only lead on the inside ?
Well , I think this is the case for some medals , in Vancouver , the medals had a weight of six hundred grams .
If that was supposed to be genuine gold , I wouldn't stand here , I would be in the Bahamas , I guess .
Or at least in Liechtenstein , somewhere in a tax haven like that .
But as I said , I think the actual reason why you do this is rather to be able to realize , what did I just create and how did I concentrate my abilities and strengths on one point .
How did I trust in me , in my abilities , but also in a team that we all need , regardless of whether it's in your studies , in your job , wherever .
Regardless of whether you're an old man or a young woman , we need people who we can trust .
And if we then focus clearly on this objective and also reach it , this is the best proof that at least in one project in our life , we were able to trust .
Because if you succeed in one area , you will definitely be able to do so in other areas .
Thank you very much , thank you .
A science for me , that's the title of my talk that has been created after your beautiful cards got printed .
What drives me is the deep wish to establish natural sciences in the everyday life of the general populace again .
Actually , I could be satisfied .
When I take a look at a bookstore , there are meters of shelves filled only with literature on scientific topics , which have been edited in a popular scientific way .
Even each newspaper stand offers a range of understandable popular scientific newspapers , journals , magazines , in which scientific topics , highly complex topics , are presented in a sort of understandable way .
Each TV channel has at least one television format dealing with scientific topics in one way or another .
Even , and this is totally absurd , if you look at how many journals and magazines for kids there are that deal with scientific topics .
Somehow each program already has an own offshoot on the shelf of the newspaper stand , but still this is purely about consuming .
Science is something that I may like to watch , that I may like to read about , but it does not really concern me .
The only time science is cool , that's somehow in CSI , in Breaking Bad , anywhere , that's where chemists are cool , isn't it ?
In C_S_I_ , a DNA fingerprint takes five minutes , which has nothing to do with reality , but it's cool , isn't it ?
That's something I can identify with .
Big Bang Theory , that's something I can laugh about , I don't understand the jokes , but it's great .
That is a great pity .
Because , somehow this is a little paradoxical , we will only be able to face the future with such technological questions and topics .
But at the same time nobody feels responsible for this .
I have gathered some small examples of the priority given to science or natural science especially by us .
One very famous example : a beautiful high-rise has been built in London , really amazing , the architect , let's build it kind of curvy , not so straight this time .
What happened , just now , that the sunlight falls from above into this front , I have provisionally indicated that , it is focused and then converges to a point somewhere in another district .
It received extensive press coverage , unfortunately just at that time there was a Jaguar parked there .
Too bad , the heat was concentrated in such a way that this poor Jaguar owner , who had been saving money for a really , really long time , the wing mirrors melted .
This makes you wonder , an architect like that , shouldn't he have learned this kind of thing in physics class , because , I mean , really , it's totally new that a mirror focuses things .
So , what I found , absolutely new , is Archimedes , sort of two hundred before Christ , when he allegedly sank a fleet using radiation .
This really makes me wonder , is he more of a designer or an architect or where did he study ?
Now this is a particularly acute example .
Furthermore , a classic example of how important such recent topics are , is genetic engineering .
Genetic engineering , some years have passed since that was kind of entering the media .
At that point it was already too late , because genetically modified plants , that was suddenly dangerous .
Genes was synonymous with green genetic engineering .
Somehow , genes were something evil .
Right , oh , that contains genes .
It happened that the farmers on the market really advertised claiming : hey , I've got gene-free vegetables .
No idea what that's supposed to be , you know .
Well , yes , okay , Dutch tomatoes , that's debatable .
But at that time I was still working in the laboratory and at some point I was totally frustrated because I was trying to introduce those evil genes into my bacteria , those damned stupid things .
And I was totally frustrated , got home , and my neighbor back then : oh , you don't look happy , what's wrong ?
I was like : you know , I've been trying for three days to transform a little gene into my bacteria and that doesn't work at all .
That was what I was trying to explain , so some kind of double helix , genes , I thought , yes , that is sufficient , when I talk about genes , the lady will know what she means .
This was what I wanted to say , so a certain sequence which I wanted to get into those goddamn coli bacteria .
But this was what the lady understood .
This woman never shook my hand again !
Who knows what I infect her with , you know ?
Genes are something absolutely evil .
That was a good ten years ago , and still somehow this got stuck in people's minds .
Gene , that is some kind of evil thing .
I haven't read the word gene-free for quite some time now .
It always says no genetic engineering , however , it has really found its way into our every day language .
Europe allows genetic super-corn , was one headline .
Genetic corn is fundamentally different from other corn that , as we know , doesn't contain any genes at all .
Another headline , genetic corn causes early death to rats .
Yes , that , too , was a nice headline .
But they are not very old and also it doesn't matter on which level I am .
No matter if the Zeit or the Bild , they all talk about genetic corn .
Fortunately it hasn't been added to the Duden yet , but I fear it won't be long before that happens .
But this simply shows the uncertainty prevailing amongst the populace , because they don't have enough insight in the subject .
However , we will have to deal with technologies like this in our future .
Only recently there have been parliamentary elections , nobody really had this subject on their program , but there are things elected and voted on of which most people don't really have an idea .
And that is quite said .
By the way , how does this information get out of the laboratory and into the public ?
If we assume that this little , young , motivated scientist is sitting in his laboratory , has an experiment , is doing research on something , good and well , and he thinks , man , now this is something , this will concern the public .
Then this has to go to the professor first .
Then the boss , he decides , okay , great topic , puts his name on it as first author , that's always important in science , being first author .
Good idea , however I'm not in the public yet , it's passed on to the spokesperson .
Well , the spokesperson thinks , oh , nice idea , great , we will make a press release for it .
Mhm , now we have a press release with a project , a nice idea , and then somehow this leaves the ivory tower .
Then it is published , yeah , but to whom , really ?
Now , these institutes are rarely on their own , usually several research institutes share one competent institution , one research community .
And out of all these the outputs , the really cool projects , are passed on by the spokespersons to the magazines , to the chief editors , be it Leibniz or Fraunhofer or Helmholtz or the Max Planck Society .
That's the way .
From the basis it is filtered more and more on its way up the ivory tower until finally the really , really cool experiments , the really noteworthy projects , appear in those magazines .
These are magazines of high quality , they are really well-made , they are for free , yes , but who do I reach ?
In fact , only those who are interested in it .
In the science communication we always call this the conversion of the catholics .
Meaning those , wo are already interested anyway , they also subscribe to the journal , yeah , good and well .
Beautiful magazines , reaching the target audience , those who are interested and who do maybe have a rough idea of what these articles actually are about .
But who do I really reach with this ?
The catholics , who are interested anyway .
No , now that was yes , the average consumer , I will call him Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze , who might read other publications , I have tried to keep it neutral , I don't really reach him that way .
Nonetheless , again , we will only be able to master our future if we deal with these future technologies .
Fracking , genetic technology , renewable energies , stem cell research , these are all subjects which are highly complex , but which Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze cannot really understand and on which he is supposed to vote somehow .
So my project , my idea is to use a different approach , to take this little , young , motivated scientist out of the ivory tower , to really separate him completely from his usual professional community and to have him take a course , a seminar , on how to communicate science in an understandable way .
Because what happens most of the time , that a scientist well , I have a friend , we have known each other for a good twenty years , he is an electrical engineer , it is an unwritten rule among us not to ask him about his job .
As soon as he opens his mouth and talks about his job we are left behind .
You know , that is the way scientists are , they tell you something about dihydrogen monoxide .
Whew , sounds chemical , doesn't it , chemical is almost about on the same level as genes .
Chemically treated , somehow that's something where you don't know what's behind it .
To really teach him , listen to me , that is good and well , when you are attending a conference and you want to tell your people , your professionals , something on eye level , then you are free to tell them about dihydrogen monoxid , but for heaven's sake , just call it water .
What is the big problem with really breaking it down and speaking normally ?
So I train , that's my idea , these young scientists , who are not yet that advanced in the hierarchy , who are still malleable to some extend , I teach them how to argue in an understandable way .
This is beneficial for everyone , third-party sponsors , investors , they also want to know what is going on there in the research institutes .
After all this is also about using taxpayers' money , so in fact they also have to communicate with the taxpayers .
But this training , that's just one part of the story .
On top of that , I really want to put them in front of a jury and have them present their project , their project in front of a jury , tough , merciless , honest , it couldn't be worse : kids .
There is a quote , I don't know if it's genuine , by Albert Einstein : if you can't explain it simply , you don't understand it well enough .
So , to take the scientists out of their laboratory and really reconsider their project asking how can I really communicate this in a way that a normal person understands ?
There are already a number of things like this .
Children's universities are totally modern , they are customary everywhere , at each university , but there , again , I actually only reach the catholics .
Who are the people who go to the most remote end of the town on some Sunday morning to attend a lecture at impossible hours ?
They are those who are interested anyway .
Then I have my newspaper reader again .
So these are the people who are interested anyway , who go there and listen to individual lectures .
That's nice , they do some kind of exciting experiments , everybody is satisfied , everybody is happy , goes home and that's it .
That is why I rely on a second aspect , which is to say , presenting the project one single time is not all there is to it .
These scientists are also trained on the way kids think .
Because many of them have really forgotten to focus on the essential .
Because scientists , the way they do research is identical to the way kids learn to know their world .
Kids work in an extremely scientific way .
They do anything , that is how they learn to walk .
They try something , does that work ?
Smack , falling down , no , doesn't work , next try , I change some of the parameters and do it once again .
Kids have an extremely scientific way of learning things .
These are really research processes , trial-and-error , I look what happens , which factors I need to change so that it works or not .
That is normal !
But this is something many have forgotten .
That's why I think , the only way this can really work is when a mentoring partnership emerges afterwards and the scientists , over a longer period of time , do the kids' experiments in the neighborhood , in their surrounding area with kids from the kindergartens , from the elementary schools , on their eye-level , and they really get involved in it there , because I am convinced that the kids and the scientists speak the same language after all .
And then maybe , maybe someday , that is my hope , the kids talk about this at home and then I reach Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze as well , who is suddenly getting interested in scientific subjects , because the kids tell him about it .
Then that's not in some journal , that's not on Galileo , but his kids tell him something about having worked with a concave mirror , baking bread there , setting paper on fire , and then maybe he , too , shakes his head at how an architect can construct a building like this .
And not only do I then reach Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze , of course , but also the newspaper reader .
That is my idea , my vision , my project .
Unfortunately at the moment the problem is that the first test candidates I called said , yeah , no , well , communication skills for our scientists , that's not on our schedule at the moment , they've got other priorities at the moment .
You know , a scientist doesn't need to be able to communicate .
And then I think , yeah , okay , I'll call the next one then .
But anyone who somehow works at an institute , who is electrical engineer in some company , whatever it is , the next break is coming up .
Thank you very much .
Am I crazy , that is the question .
And you cannot fly every day , either .
The last couple of weeks were awful .
The weather largely thwarted our plans .
Seven , almost eight years ago , I was asked whether I wanted to take over this here .
I was chief executive before , for almost ten years , at the Dornier Aircrafts in Munich an in Pfaffenhofen .
We climbed up rather high .
Lufthansa was one of our clients .
And for me it was kind of , well , it is rather a hobby .
Why are people actually doing this ?
Airships , that is actually ridiculous.
However , I got to know who is behind it and that is why I am here today .
And yes , maybe it is a bit crazy , but at any rate , it is also highly emotional .
It is great , always exciting and really fun .
And I am going to tell you in the follow seventeen , eighteen minutes how it is to be the chief of a Zeppelin Airship Company .
I am the chief of the Zeppelin Airship Construction Company .
The company has been existing for one hundred and five years .
I am the chief of the Zeppelin Airship Technology Company .
This company has been existing for twenty years .
And chief of the EZR .
The company has been existing for approximately nineteen or eighteen years .
They run Zeppelin here at Lake Constance .
Zeppelin .
That is a photo I want to show you here , the small dot on the right , that is actually a dot , or something , I don't know , yes exactly this dot is still too big .
There are only twenty-three airships worldwide .
And from them , only ten are still active today .
And this means something .
There are about twenty thousand active commercial aircrafts worldwide .
Thus, this is actually no real market .
This is not even a niche .
This is a unicum , something exotic .
And there is also the question : why are people actually doing this ?
How does it actually work ?
A stock of twenty-three and only ten active ones , we can talk about the reason for that later .
Very shortly to the history .
In nineteen hundred an Earl , who many people described as crazy , founded the aircraft here .
A short summary .
Brought into being about eighteen aircrafts until nineteen fourteen , before the first World War .
Then during the first World War , by the way , Earl Zeppelin died in nineteen seventeen , about eighty-eight aircrafts were built for war's aim .
They then bombed London and so on and so forth .
And when we came to London in two thousand eight and flew there a campaign with a big beverage corporation for three months and the English newspapers where filled on both sides with the headline : this time they came , but not with bombs , but in peace .
And like this the story worked into it .
And we had a crazy campaign .
But Inbev , the client , was not so happy about it , because he suddenly realized what else there is behind , how many old memories are in it .
And well that was a bit critical for the people from the marketing .
But however it was a great campaign in London , apart from the weather in the North , up there the weather has already been very bad and very windy many years ago .
And we didn't fly a lot .
And then in nineteen twenty , in nineteen twenty-one Hugo Eckener took over .
And created a reparation aircraft that was then delivered to America .
This was the basis for a myth that the whole German nation began to feel something anew , when in nineteen twenty-four the aircraft was hijacked .
And then it was welcomed in New York with a parade of confetti .
And the whole German nation got up and yeah , again we are someone .
You can find this in every bibliography and this explains a bit the myth of this machine .
However , until nineteen thirty-seven only five , six , seven zeppelins were built and actually only two really big ones , the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg , that carried passengers .
Passengers , one hundred , about seventy-nine passengers and together it was at the end one hundred and nineteen .
But it was a myth .
And the Hindenburg accident was at that time the first accident that was directly filmed and , yes , with lethal consequence .
Apart from the titanic , the event at that time when an icon , a product went down and then never flew again afterwards .
The other machines were stopped , too .
And in nineteen thirty-nine , in nineteen forty the last still existing zeppelins were destroyed .
The material was used to build aircrafts for the war , the halls were dismantled .
Then there was nothing for about sixty years .
And then the shareholder ZF Friedrichshafen and Zeppelin had the idea , maybe we should relaunch .
And I was hired in two thousand five because although one wanted to develop a technically great product , we will come to that in a minute , but the market .
Well , is it a real market ?
And what is happening ?
Well .
We will talk about this now .
The Earl Zeppelin , I briefly have to explain this , yeah it is okay with the time , isn't it , achieved a lot .
There are a lot of companies that developed from this group .
Today , it is eighty thousand employees , a volume of about twenty billions .
That is a real economic power , highly profitable .
There is a lot behind it .
And then they convinced me to come over here .
The Zeppelin itself is actually a pretty normal aircraft , just like any other aircraft but , excuse me , has a gas inside of it , helium not hydrogen , and in it also a gas management with gas bags .
It is like a whale that goes up and down in the water and that has to equalize the pressure .
We don't have the time now to go more into detail.
This is the inside of a Zeppelin , with a structure .
There are two kinds of airships .
There are rigid airships , that's what we are , friction rigid in this case and non-rigid airships .
They have no structure inside and they are like balloons in the form of a cigarette .
They make up for most of the airships that were built all over the world , about four , five hundred .
And today there are only twenty-three left of them as a stock minus our own stock , so only about twenty .
This is how the production looks like , when an envelope is fit .
On the left side , once again the structure .
And the envelope is also highly technological .
It derives from the aerospace technology .
Origin : the space suits of the astronauts .
The landing on the moon at that time is the origin .
An envelope costs one point two million Euros .
And it has to be gas-tight and tear-proof and has to block UV light , because over and over you have to check that even if there was a rupture or a hole , that is would not become bigger .
This is where the employees work very detailed and check if there are any holes .
And in the end , an aircraft without its attachment looks like this .
Thus , the zeppelin is from a technical point of view a highly developed product .
And his we can see from the figures here , just shortly .
One point nine per cent , one point nine per cent , one point six four percent failure rate , this means that from thousand flights over the year about sixteen fail .
This is really not much and really , really good .
This is an industrial market .
It's nothing to sneeze at .
But there is another trend we are worried about at the moment and I depicted it to you up here .
Three years ago , we had to cancel or change forty-three percent of the flights because of the weather , when I had started in two thousand five , eight years ago , thirty-five per cent , and last year forty-seven per cent .
And this year in May we were at sixty per cent .
When you take the eight years , my eight years , at Zeppelin and try to do climate research , you can at least say that during these eight years , a very short period of course in climate research , in these eight year the weather conditions have significantly changed for us .
We are at the mercy of the wind .
We can neither fly our passengers through fog .
They want to see something .
And every year we actually have to cancel or change more flights .
The idea that we don't only have the feeling that the weather changes , but that it also changes statistically , because we make weather every day .
But because of this reason and this is something positive now , the EU started a program to do climate research , almost ten million Euros and we are a major part of this program .
I just came here from Finland this morning .
The airship is equipped here , it became a flying laboratory .
The campaign is named Pegasos .
And we analyze the air of the boundary layer between the earth's surface and two thousand meters .
It is called planetary boundary layer .
And the Zeppelin T flies from Italy up to Finland in a program that lasts altogether seven months .
For many hundred hours of flight it measures and analyses the air , how it reacts to our things that we are doing down there on earth .
There , as I have already explained , at the moment , we are up there with our second airship .
A great mission .
And it derives , if you want to see it like that , directly from the topic weather .
So it works really well .
These here are some further impressions .
The airship over Sweden last week or the week before .
And in Finland the weather is great , isn't it , twenty-five degrees , thirty degrees .
The people in Finland say that they have never had this before .
I just had some beautiful and pretty warm days over there .
Like that the mosquitoes weren't finally that bad .
We also have been to Africa .
And we had a special mission from De Beers to look for diamonds , I better have to say that we looked for subterranean volcanoes that have been ablated due to erosion for millions of years .
And now you can also ask yourself , all this is Africa , does it make sense that at the same time the film bloody or Blood Diamonds% is at the cinemas ?
I asked myself , what are we doing here ?
And what are we supporting here ?
In the end , we were finished after two years .
And the ode didn't continue .
The whole world crisis came in two thousand eight and the project was thus finished .
And a tornado damaged the mast of the Zeppelin that badly that it could directly stay down on earth .
But that wasn't that bad .
We had a quite good insurance and we were actually kind of glad .
Admittedly , this was the prototype.
And I didn't know what to do with it .
Yes , what we do today , a short abstract of business economics .
What we do today , it's about complexity , it's about questions , growth and continuance .
What we do today is the airship plant here in Friedrichshafen .
We do maintenance of course .
We always have to preserve the Zeppelin .
Obsolescence means aging .
There are devices inside of it that have to be replaced after ten , fifteen years again .
At the moment we are replacing the whole avionic system for almost five million Euros .
There, with the client Goodyear , we will talk about that .
We always have to do the basic development .
We are an aeronautically approved plant that is controlled by the German Aerospace Center and the European supervision , always and continuously , with inspections such as Lufthansa or also Airbus .
This is laborious and expensive and has to be maintained .
The question is : do we continue ?
Do we want to continue developing ?
Do we build bigger airships ?
There are cargo airships , pilotless airships .
What are we doing there ?
Do we go further in the market ?
Do we go further in the plants ?
And we certainly also tried this during my time .
And we also suffered defeats .
As well as the Earl Zeppelin suffered defeats and broke many times .
At the beginning , the donations from nineteen eight were written on the charts .
The German population saved him at that time with a donation of six million gold mark when the forth airship had an accident and he was broke , the population donated for him .
And from that the zeppelin company airship Zeppelin and the other companies derived , otherwise I wouldn't be here today and the other companies wouldn't be here either .
We were in Tokyo , dream city .
We were , you hear past tense , in San Francisco with a client .
There is a very potent investor behind it .
Unfortunately , both projects failed .
So also defeats .
At the same time we won Goodyear .
I have no picture for that since we are not allowed to show the Goodyear emblem yet .
But mainly in America the construction of the first Goodyear airship is almost finished .
We sold three .
Together with Goodyear , and a partner , we develop a new technology .
And this is a great success , but a defeat at the same time .
Two clients were liquidated because it hadn't worked any more .
Why didn't it work ?
We actually know the reason .
Either the location wasn't the right one or it was too far away for the passengers or in America they knew the non-rigid airships with commercials for the last thirty forty years .
The people looked up , saw the airship , and said : nice , another one , another non-rigid airship doing advertisement .
They didn't know that they can fly with it .
And it was even harder for the marketing to show this : hey , call us for a flight .
The lake Constance works well .
The pilots transport , welcome twelve thousand , thirteen thousand passengers a year .
But last year , we only had eleven thousand because of the weather .
Thus , half a million is directly missing .
This is bad .
The Zeppelin flies sixteen routes here .
It is the sense , that is of course pretty , when I , as a chief , see the passengers get out and everybody laughs and when we do not actually do advertisement because it is passed on from person to person and we always sell about thirteen thousand coupons and the people say , that is so nice , and recommend it to their friends and acquaintances and to whoever in their family .
And we are well booked .
Whereby I have to clear up the misunderstanding that we are booked out .
We can always fly more .
We have kind of a Nimbus at the Lake Constance and we would be booked out .
That is actually not true .
We also do advertisement .
This was once an art project sponsored by Audi .
And Audi did it together with the island Mainau .
But the advertising market is a difficult market .
And sometimes you have to ask : is it always reasonable to do advertisement ?
We do actually have enough advertisement , but the Internet has changed a lot , the flying ban form the start on because the big sponsors control everything .
The advertising market has almost broken away , therefore we only have ten active airships in the world today left .
We have three of them here .
Two actives ones , one wrapped up , the America airship , three were bought by Goodyear , the are active .
So six out of ten .
This means that we will actually control the market , if it is one .
And hope that we can derive a future from this .
And what at the end David Scott , commandant of Apollo fifteen , after a flight with a Zeppelin in Paris in two thousand five , he said : just the walk on the moon was nicer .
So it is great to fly with a zeppelin .
We also like advertising .
But we don't find any clients .
We like special missions , it has a technological value .
There we have clients .
It is not consistent .
It is amorphous , goes up and down .
You need several years to get a mission from the government .
And then there are non for some years .
There are also weird effects that are difficult to control .
In any case , there is this situation , airships , an aspect in the world market , actually no market .
We continue nevertheless .
It is an icon of the region .
The shareholders have the power to do it .
They are just wondering at the moment : in which way do we continue ?
How many money do we want to spend in the world market ?
What do we do for the region here ?
In which way do we want to run this ?
And me personally , you asked me to say something personal , I am apart from my background Dornier , when I wanted to save Dornier , at that time there were a lot of resistance , EADS also wanted to trample to death the little Dornier , it's about saving here , too .
Once I have been at Greenpeace for three years , financial ship , when I drove through Vancouver Island and I saw all the destroyed jungle , I was so angry that I asked for a job there .
And at that time , there was a succession of articles in the Spiegel about Greenpeace who were swamped with money and didn't know what to do with it and almost perished of it .
Then they hired me to restructure the whole thing .
And I was the chief financial officer of Greenpeace for three years and now I am doing this here hoping to have a great future with Zeppelin .
Zero , is it correct , forty seconds , I've nevertheless finished , thank you .
Applause
